This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate.

For the past two years, my laboratory and collaborators have been studying six offspring of a dairy bull, genome-edited to prevent it from growing horns. This technology has been proposed as an alternative to dehorning, a common management practice performed to protect other cattle and human handlers from injuries. We found that none of the bull's offspring developed horns, as expected, and blood work and physical exams of the calves found they were all healthy. We also sequenced the genomes of the calves and their parents and analyzed these genomic sequences. Our study found that two calves inherited the naturally-occurring hornless allele, and four calves additionally inherited a fragment of bacterial DNA, known as a plasmid. This study has generated some media interest, and I am here to answer questions about the study, and genome editing more generally.

On a personal note I'm originally from Australia where I completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at The University of Melbourne, before completing my Masters and Ph.D. in Genetics at UC Davis. I have now lived in California for over 30 years with my husband who is a reproductive biologist studying white sturgeon.

So, how does propagation of action potentials work?

If so, why wouldn't the time-sensitive Na+ inactivation gates close, similar to hyperkalemia? I guess I'm just not sure how prolonged depolarization has to be in order to shut the gates. I'm pretty sure it's only a fraction of a second, so why wouldn't they close in this case?

Also, how does automaticity work? Since there are no EPSPs or IPSPs giving the initial stimulation, what is? I read that there are less inward rectifier K+ channels, so the potential never returns to the negative charge needed for fast Na+ channels to become active, so would this mean that it's simply the leakage of Na+ through the slow channels that bump it up to the \~ -55mV needed to open up the calcium channels?

If so, why wouldn&amp;#39;t the time-sensitive Na+ inactivation gates close, similar to hyperkalemia? I guess I&amp;#39;m just not sure how prolonged depolarization has to be in order to shut the gates. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s only a fraction of a second, so why wouldn&amp;#39;t they close in this case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, how does automaticity work? Since there are no EPSPs or IPSPs giving the initial stimulation, what is? I read that there are less inward rectifier K+ channels, so the potential never returns to the negative charge needed for fast Na+ channels to become active, so would this mean that it&amp;#39;s simply the leakage of Na+ through the slow channels that bump it up to the ~ -55mV needed to open up the calcium channels? If so, why is this called &amp;quot;spontaneous,&amp;quot; especially if there&amp;#39;s a steady beat, all else equal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, I&amp;#39;d love to know how exactly the action potential cycle actually causes contraction. I get that it does, but how?&lt;/p&gt;

Roughly one out of every eight American women will develop invasive breast cancer at some point in her lifetime, making it the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in American women.

In recognition of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) have partnered to bring you an ""Ask Me Anything"" with two prominent researchers in the NCI's Women's Malignancies Branch: Stanley Lipkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., and Alexandra Zimmer, M.D. Dr. Lipkowitz studies cellular and molecular pathways that regulate the growth and destruction of breast and ovarian cancer cells, while Dr. Zimmer, the Branch's Clinical Director, develops translational clinical trials to study treatments for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, particularly the brain. She also investigates ways of preventing breast cancer from leaving the breast in the first place, a
process known as metastasis.

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."". 

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

Hydrogen and fuel cells are the perfect partners for clean, fuel-efficient transportation and a secure energy future. Here at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), we have expertise in creating low carbon hydrogen from natural gas, and we have two projects we want to discuss with you. The first is Solar Thermochemical Advanced Reactor System-or STARS, a technology that converts a record-setting 70 percent of solar energy into chemical energy, such as hydrogen. STARS uses thermal energy from the sun to break down natural gas and water into hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a steam methane reforming process. PNNL licensed STARS to a spin-off company, STARS, LLC, who is working with Southern California Gas Company to implement the technology. Read about STARS here: https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/05/20181518-stars.html.

The second project uses a low-emission process to convert natural gas to hydrogen, carbon fiber, and carbon nanotubes. The process creates hydrogen that can be used in fuel cell vehicles and industrial processes, as well as carbon fiber that can be used in applications from medical devices and aerospace structures to building products. The goal of the project is to make hydrogen-fueled cars and trucks cost-competitive with conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. In addition, this technology would virtually eliminate CO2 emissions from the methane-to-hydrogen process. The technology development and commercialization team includes PNNL; West Virginia University; Southern California Gas Company; and C4-MCP, a Santa Monica-based start-up company. Read more about project here: https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/01/20180105-socalgas.html.

Whatever DM is, it interacts with gravity so there should at all times be a steady stream of DM falling past the SMBH's event horizon and on to the singularity, never to emerge except via Hawking radiation in the far future.

Many galaxies are disc-shaped but their DM tends to exist in a (more) spherical globule surrounding the galactic center (GC), according to artist's impressions of DM distribution, which are of course based on whatever the physics is that's being illustrated. I have to assume those images are accurate depictions.

So if those images are showing globules of DM surrounding GCs, why are those globs of DM still there? Why doesn't the SMBH ""vacuum"" it all up within a few million years, or whatever relatively short time scale?

**Tell me if this is wrong:** DM exists in elliptical orbits around GCs. But those orbital paths would be distorted by other stars near the SMBH, causing some of the DM to be accelerated into the SMBC on a steady basis until there was none left outside the EH.

But it *seems* that doesn't happen. What's really going on? It seems that the still unknown exact nature of DM wouldn't affect the problem as I've stated it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;THANKS everyone, I have the answer.

&lt;p&gt;Whatever DM is, it interacts with gravity so there should at all times be a steady stream of DM falling past the SMBH&amp;#39;s event horizon and on to the singularity, never to emerge except via Hawking radiation in the far future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many galaxies are disc-shaped but their DM tends to exist in a (more) spherical globule surrounding the galactic center (GC), according to artist&amp;#39;s impressions of DM distribution, which are of course based on whatever the physics is that&amp;#39;s being illustrated. I have to assume those images are accurate depictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if those images are showing globules of DM surrounding GCs, why are those globs of DM still there? Why doesn&amp;#39;t the SMBH &amp;quot;vacuum&amp;quot; it all up within a few million years, or whatever relatively short time scale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me if this is wrong:&lt;/strong&gt; DM exists in elliptical orbits around GCs. But those orbital paths would be distorted by other stars near the SMBH, causing some of the DM to be accelerated into the SMBC on a steady basis until there was none left outside the EH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; that doesn&amp;#39;t happen. What&amp;#39;s really going on? It seems that the still unknown exact nature of DM wouldn&amp;#39;t affect the problem as I&amp;#39;ve stated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;A team of Ontario researchers says their latest study could help pave the way for different approaches to treating depression.

&gt;The study – completed at McMaster University’s Brain-Body Institute and published this week in Scientific Reports – concluded a common class of antidepressants works by stimulating activity in the gut and key nerves connected to it rather than the brain as previously believed.

&gt;The research focused on Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of antidepressant that’s known to benefit patients but whose functioning is little understood by the medical community.

&gt;The McMaster researchers spent nearly a year testing SSRIs on mice in a bid to solve the puzzle.

&gt;They found that mice taking the medication showed much greater stimulation of neurons in the gut wall, as well as the vagus nerve that connects the gut to the brain. Those benefits disappeared if the vagus nerve was surgically cut.

&gt;Study co-author Karen-Anne McVey Neufeld says the findings suggest the gut may play a larger role in depression than previously believed and the latest research hints at new treatment possibilities in the future.

For example, wikipedia says that mercury changes from a solid density of 13.69 g/cm\^3 to a liquid density of 14.184 g/cm\^3 at its melting point of -38.83 degrees C ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury\_(element)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element))). But if I had a super precise heat control that could let me control the temperature down to hundredths of a mK if necessary (and plenty of time to let the sample fully equilibrate), could I get a mercury sample of, say, 13.9 g/cm\^3?

&amp;#x200B;

I had always thought of density as changing discontinuously during melting, but I realize now that at least some other phase change properties are not totally discontinuous even when we may think of them that way. Electrical resistance, for instance, is not totally discontinuous when undergoing a superconductivity phase change, but instead transitions rapidly over a few mK. This is even the basis of very sensitive thermometers called ""Transition Edge Sensors (TES)"" ([http://web.mit.edu/figueroagroup/ucal/ucal\_tes/](http://web.mit.edu/figueroagroup/ucal/ucal_tes/)).

&amp;#x200B;

So does density during melting behave like electrical resistance during super conductivity transition (IE changing fast but nonetheless continuously with temperature)? Or is it truly discontinuous, with no possibility of achieving a density between the two transition values, regardless of how finely one can control the temperature?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the density as a function of temperature for a pure substance change discontinuously at its melting point?

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

I've also just published a new popular maths book called the Math(s) of Life and Death which is [out in the UK](https://amzn.to/2MkmdcM) and available to [pre-order in the US](https://www.amazon.com/Math-Life-Death-Mathematical-Principles/dp/1982111879/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?crid=VWXFWH6IJA6W&amp;keywords=the+maths+of+life+and+death+kit+yates&amp;qid=1564181090&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=the+math+of+life+and+death+%2Caps%2C120&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0). In the book I explore the true stories of life-changing events in which the application (or misapplication) of mathematics has played a critical role: patients crippled by faulty genes and entrepreneurs bankrupt by faulty algorithms; innocent victims of miscarriages of justice and the unwitting victims of software glitches. I follow stories of investors who have lost fortunes and parents who have lost children, all because of mathematical misunderstanding. I wrestle with ethical dilemmas from screening to statistical subterfuge and examine pertinent societal issues such as political referenda, disease prevention, criminal justice and artificial intelligence. I show that mathematics has something profound or significant to say on all of these subjects, and more.

What I mean - this EM wave generated by the transmitter is going in all directions from the source, forming a sphere and spreading through vacuum (at least that's the way I understand it). I also understand that those waves carry energy in some way (correct me if I'm wrong). As we get furtherer from the source there are more points where we can receive this wave (thus the energy it's carrying).

The Society of Hair Testing says that hair samples should be prepped with an organic solvent wash followed by aqueous washes to remove contaminants. 

However, a 3-year-old paper discovered that if the hair is somehow contaminated with cocaine (I guess either through lab error or maybe the person goes to places where cocaine particulates/vapor is in the air) the cocaine will permeate throughout the hair and present like user hair. 

The authors looked at the cross-section of hair with a MetA-SIMS (TRIFT II TOF-SIMS) and compared it with conventional methods (LC-MS/MS). The contamination wasn't removed in the washes with organic solvents and water according to the LC-MS/MS, it permeated throughout the hair according to the TOF-SIMS. 

I'm trying to figure out 2 things. One: How does cocaine chemically enter the hair if you're a user? Two: If cocaine hydrochloride (cocaine a rich person might buy) is water soluble, why isn't it coming out in the water? Why is permeating the hair further? (However this is also true for cocaine base, or ""crack"" cocaine. Though I'm having issues determining solubility with crack cocaine.) 

FWIW, hair is composed of mostly keratin. Keratin is helical due to hydrogen bondings and has sulfate groups due to cysteine. Hair also has minerals due to diet and water, and contains lipids (cocaine vapor is lipophilic).

I want to know the average energy of the photons emitted by a LED. What I have is the graph of intensity by wavelength. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that each point in the graph is actually the intensity integrated over a small interval near that point (analogous to a displacement vs time graph where each point is the displacement during a small time interval around that time). 

&amp;#x200B;

But say that instead of that I had an actual continuous power distribution function, a graph now analogous to a velocity vs time graph. I must integrate the function over an interval of λ to find the intensity on that interval.  


I'll call that function i(λ)  (lowercase 'i' because that's not an intensity now but rather a ""density"")  


I want to convert it to a function i(f) in such a way that the integrated intensity over an equivalent interval is the same, in other words  


i(f)df = i(λ)dλ   


Once f = c/λ  -&gt;  df = (-c/λ²)dλ  -&gt;  i(f)\*(-c/λ²)dλ  = i(λ)dλ -&gt; i(f)  = -(λ²/c)i(λ)

&amp;#x200B;

So I might choose i(λ) = kλ for example. 'k' is a constant that will deal with the units. And I might choose an λ interval from a to b meters. The integral of i(λ) will be (k/2)(b²-a²)

The frequency-domain function will be i(f) = -kλ³/c = -kc²/f³ 

The primitive integral of of that function is (kc²/2)/f² + C. Integrating from c/a to c/b (the equivalent interval in the frequency domain) the the result is (kc²/2)\*\[1/(c/b)²-1/(c/a)²\]= (kc²/2)\*\[b²-a²\]/c²   
= (k/2)(b²-a²)  


This is the same result and shows that the the power distributions check - They give the same total intensity for the same interval. Being that, obviously, each function have different units once they have different domains, but the units of the integrated intensity will be the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the average value of wavelength and frequency:  


i(λ)\*λ = kλ² -&gt; integral over the interval a to b = (k/3)(b³-a³)

dividing by the integral intensity we have (k/3)(b²-a²)/\[(k/2)(b³-a³)\] -&gt; λ(av) = (2/3)(b³-a³)/(b²-a²) 

&amp;#x200B;

i(f)\*f =  -kc²/f²  -&gt; integral over the interval of c/a to c/b =  kc(b-a)  

dividing by the integral intensity we have kc(b-a) /\[(k/2)(b³-a³)\] -&gt; f(av) = 2c(b-a)(b²-a²)  

  
If I took λ(av)  and found the equivalent frequency, I'd have  c/λ(av) = c(3/2)(b²-a²)/(b³-a³), which is not the same as 2c(b-a)(b²-a²)  

For example, choosing a=100 m and b=300 m -&gt;   
λ(av) = (650/3) m,   
c/λ(av) = 1383657.50 Hz, and    
f(av)  = 1498962.29 Hz.

So far in class we've mostly just been going over the expansion of the universe, so I tried to justify the assertion in this video to myself: we cannot travel outside of our local group. 

The Hubble constant at the current time is 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. I set up an equation where the change in distance, dx, is equal to the hubble constant times the distance times the change in time, dt. Solving the differential equation, you get that the final distance is equal to about 1.03 times the initial distance over the course of 500 million years. Something about 3 mpc away (the diameter of the local group) would not even increase in distance by a megaparsec. At half the speed of light, you could travel about 77 mpc in this time. This is ~25 times the diameter of the local group.

I know that the Hubble parameter changes in time, but my textbook seemed to suggest that it would not change in any meaningful way over the course of 500 myr. Even if it increased by two orders of magnitude (I tried this by just having it start at two orders of magnitude higher), the distance is still well within travel distance.

It's often pointed out that SU(2) double covers SO(3), and that the Pauli matrices form a basis for the Lie algebra su(2) (up to a factor of i). But I'm having trouble understanding the connection.

As I understand, SU(2) is the symmetry group of spinors (as diagrams like [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Spinor_on_the_circle.png) point out - you need a double-covering of SO(3) in order to cover all spinor-space symmetries). This is why this group is so important in the theory of spin. A question that just occurred to me is why the Pauli matrices happen to form a representation of the Lie algebra su(2); does the algebra of observables of a system always have to be some representation of the system's symmetry group Lie algebra? But we can put that question to one side.

I'm especially confused because the theory of spin in quantum mechanics is usually presented as (a generalised version of) the theory of orbital angular momentum. The commutation relations between spin observables are derived in terms of the canonical commutation relations of linear position and momentum.

So then, could someone connect this intro QM exposition of spin to the groups SU(2) and SO(3)?

I'm also vaguely aware of Clifford algebra representations of spin. As far as I can tell spin states are represented by rotors which happen to double-cover SO(3). But that just kicks the can down the road: why should rotors represent angular momentum?

Can a gene's dominance somehow be determined without specific testing?

My guess would be this, if gene A is dominant over gene B and gene B is dominant over gene C can I assume gene A is also dominant over gene C? so gene A could be assigned a dominance level of 3, B assigned 2 and C assigned 1. Can someone please disprove this for me?

Alternatively maybe genes could be assigned classes, with class A being dominant over class B, class B dominant over class C, class C dominant over class A and D, and class D dominant over class B, so you can assume that if a gene is dominant over class A it must belong to class C hence also dominant over class D. Although this one might be practically impossible to prove due to a potentially infinite amount of classes, so if a gene is dominant over class A it might still not be dominant over class D and instead belong to a new class E.

Is there a more likely theory? perhaps based on experimentation rather then thoughts some kid had while walking his dog? or is this subject rather unexplored and I can't hope for an answer any time soon?

I'm trying to wrap my head around how much of this stuff I've actually consumed.

I came across this website explaining how to calculate it

[https://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20170818/what-does-140-parts-per-trillion-look-like](https://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20170818/what-does-140-parts-per-trillion-look-like)

Its my understanding that the the 1500 ppt is the total amount found in the water supply, and once you calculate how much water you injested during that contamination window you can get a rough idea of how many ppt you actually injested.

So even if you had a glass of water, that isn't the full 1500 ppt in your system, but a mere fraction of the total 1500 ppt. eg: 1x 8 oz glass out of a olympic sized swimming pool as they describe it in that article.

Assuming my thought process is correct.  Then I've actually only consumed like 0.001% of a ppt of the stuff.

Is the 70ppt a lifetime limit? eg: I could drive enough water till that 0.001% adds up to a full 70 ppt?

This mentions that heat shock proteins (HSPs) “aid in refolding of damaged or denatured proteins,” but it does not discuss the mechanism by which this is accomplished other than stating that it increases the fidelity of protein synthesis. Wikipedia seems to just state that it stabilizes partially unfolded proteins, and chaperones other proteins, as I read it across organelle membranes. I am curious of the mechanism, is it attaching to other proteins like a ribosome or enzyme? 

Also, can HSPs be used to help treat prion diseases as they are a result of misfolded proteins? I see an article in 2014 discussing this potential, and also one this year showing mice lacking genes encoding for HSP synthesis have accelerated prion disease progression. I don’t see anything further suggesting advances in trying to use HSPs for prevention or treatment of prion diseases, and maybe I’m just missing a piece of the puzzle.

I’m just curious about HSPs and their potential. I’m in a pathophysiology course and this article is suggested reading but I don’t have to do any homework related to it so I’m not asking for homework help, just trying to answer some questions that came up when reading.

I don’t see anything further suggesting advances in trying to use HSPs for prevention or treatment of prion diseases, and maybe I’m just missing a piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just curious about HSPs and their potential. I’m in a pathophysiology course and this article is suggested reading but I don’t have to do any homework related to it so I’m not asking for homework help, just trying to answer some questions that came up when reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I just had a discussion with a friend which began with the reasons for the failure of the Space Shuttle.

In the process we asked ourselves why you can't just fly straight upwards with a fighter jet to reach orbit which would cost much less than a rocket launch.

We thought that maybe it is because the jets kinetic force is too low to reach the first cosmic speed so we compared it to a falcon 9:

* The Eurofighter has a max. force of roughly 180kN and weighs 11T which is 16,4N/kg
* The Falcon 9 has 9 x \~1000kN and weighs about 550T which is also 16,4N/kg

So they both have around the same force per kg - shouldn't a Eurofighter then be able to just fly to space (maybe with some extra tanks)?

Maybe there is a obvious reason why this can't work so thank you for your answers :)

My question is why?

If you ask why hydrogen **GAS** is so light/low-density it's because of the ideal gas laws and how 1 mole of a gas fills the same volume regardless of which gas it is therefore the gas with the smallest molecular mass will be lightest. But that's not why **LIQUID / Cryogenic** Hydrogen is so light / low density. 

The hydrogen atom is very very small so logically it should be pretty easy to compress it down to a tiny size.

My understanding always was that you have some type of reel that spins and has the successive frames be illuminated in quick succession by a light source thus seemingly making the picture ""move"". However, I cannot see a reason for why the picture with the edges of the image should align with the edges of the screen. In other words, at any point in time it's as likely that I have a full still frame illuminated as that I have half of each of two successive frames illuminated or any other possible position. Why shouldn't we just see everything blurry (a superposition of all possible illuminated positions).

I am very likely grossly misunderstanding something and it''s bothering me a lot.

My research focuses on a special class of neutron stars called millisecond pulsars. 

Yesterday, a paper I led along with my colleagues\* in the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves ([NANOGrav](http://nanograv.org/)) collaboration was published in Nature Astronomy. It details our measurement of what is very likely the most massive neutron star ever detected. The source, called J0740+6620, weighs in at 2.14 solar masses. 

In short, this result was obtained by observing a general relativistic effect called [Shapiro delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro_time_delay) in a pulsar-white dwarf binary system with the [Green Bank](https://greenbankobservatory.org/) telescope, and combining that data with five years of NANOGrav observations of the pulsar. No other neutron stars have measured masses that exceed 2 solar masses outside their 1-sigma confidence intervals, so we're really excited about this result! The main motivation behind these kinds of measurements is to constrain the very poorly understood neutron star [equation of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state).

The paper can be found [here](https://rdcu.be/bRdPP), and [here's](https://go.nature.com/307tCUg) a more accessible summary of it that I wrote for Nature Astronomy. You can find me on twitter [@HannahThankful](https://twitter.com/HannahThankful).

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

&lt;p&gt;my question i have to ask you i thought if oobleck can turn into a solid and a liquid it mite be able to turn into gas.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."". 

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate.

Except the one about left handed people but the conclusion there was not really about distance to the brain (although the theorem was that that would explain the difference? I'm unsure) 

So.. Does distance needed for nerve signals matter? Does it matter significantly? If so do they need to travel to the brain?

If the wavelength is shorter than the circumference would we not have a band of orbits which will never destructivley interfere and hence not limit ourselves to the simpler situation of discrete energy levels for the e-? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as a mathematician, if space around the e- is compact these allowed orbits (to me) represent the limit points of allowed orbits and that in the real world you would have a band of &amp;#39;effectively&amp;#39; allowed orbits which would be stable for long periods of time without ever collapsing into the nucleus or flying out into space.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12525/12525-h/12525-h.htm#chapter2.1

&gt;A live sucking-fish (Echeneis remora) having previously been secured by a line passed round the tail, is thrown into the water in certain places known to be suitable for the purpose; the fish while swimming about makes fast by its sucker to any turtle of this small kind which it may chance to encounter, and both are hauled in together!

Is there a more specific subset of zoology or anthropology that studies the ways humans have cohabited with wild animals or used them as a part of their culture?

Stories and accounts like using bears to locate honey hives, [using ants to suture wounds](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9akjpz/you-can-use-ants-to-stitch-a-wound), [following baboons to water](https://books.google.com/books?id=STNGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=baboon+water+bushmen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GhO8rYsRyj&amp;sig=1oM3qgpwoXcrh3IiBkGnwVE8LN4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK4cX4suHVAhXnrFQKHUYeBec4FBDoAQgyMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=baboon%20water%20bushmen&amp;f=false), tying string around a [cormorants neck and having them catch fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNEplaYZtpI), etc.

I especially prefer non-city interactions, though something like the battle between [raccoons and human garbage infrastructure in the current day](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/raccoon-resistance/) is also interesting.

What study is this? When reading through articles and papers on Anthrozoology I see only discussions of domesticated animals, humans handling species in conservation, and cultures trading in exotics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounted here under &amp;quot;MODE OF CATCHING TURTLE&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12525/12525-h/12525-h.htm#chapter2.1""&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12525/12525-h/12525-h.htm#chapter2.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A live sucking-fish (Echeneis remora) having previously been secured by a line passed round the tail, is thrown into the water in certain places known to be suitable for the purpose; the fish while swimming about makes fast by its sucker to any turtle of this small kind which it may chance to encounter, and both are hauled in together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a more specific subset of zoology or anthropology that studies the ways humans have cohabited with wild animals or used them as a part of their culture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories and accounts like using bears to locate honey hives, &lt;a href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9akjpz/you-can-use-ants-to-stitch-a-wound""&gt;using ants to suture wounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=STNGAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA106&amp;amp;lpg=PA106&amp;amp;dq=baboon+water+bushmen&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=GhO8rYsRyj&amp;amp;sig=1oM3qgpwoXcrh3IiBkGnwVE8LN4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK4cX4suHVAhXnrFQKHUYeBec4FBDoAQgyMAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=baboon%20water%20bushmen&amp;amp;f=false""&gt;following baboons to water&lt;/a&gt;, tying string around a &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNEplaYZtpI""&gt;cormorants neck and having them catch fish&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially prefer non-city interactions, though something like the battle between &lt;a href=""https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/raccoon-resistance/""&gt;raccoons and human garbage infrastructure in the current day&lt;/a&gt; is also interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What study is this? When reading through articles and papers on Anthrozoology I see only discussions of domesticated animals, humans handling species in conservation, and cultures trading in exotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of those: &lt;a href=""https://www.depauw.edu/humanimalia/index.html""&gt;https://www.depauw.edu/humanimalia/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know of the field I&amp;#39;m seeking, and what is the more specific term for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

It occurred to me that a big difference between nuclear reactor and conventional combustion is the ""sense"" of the reaction.  With nuclear, the fuel alone reaches criticality and then generates heat on its own, and to control the reaction, it requires stuff (boron, water) to slow down or stop the reaction.  With conventional combustion, it's the opposite: the combustion of the fuel requires actively combining a fuel and an oxidizer (oxygen and a hydrocarbon generally).  There is no need to slow down the combustion for a given unit of fuel - a given unit of fuel will burn completely.  But there is an ""easy"" way to slow down or stop the reactor: stop adding either fuel or oxidizer (usually both).

I was thinking about trying to achieve the same sense of reaction with nuclear.  Would it be possible to have a very small piece of fissile material, no chance of being critical on its own, and fire neutrons at it out of a some sort of neutron generator?  You fire enough neutrons to get some of the fissile material to undergo fission, but it would never reach criticality on its own, it would require continuous bombardment by external neutrons to undergo fission.  When you want to stop the reaction, you shut off the external neutron source.

EDIT 9/8: It looks like this has been conceived by real physicists:

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that a big difference between nuclear reactor and conventional combustion is the &amp;quot;sense&amp;quot; of the reaction.  With nuclear, the fuel alone reaches criticality and then generates heat on its own, and to control the reaction, it requires stuff (boron, water) to slow down or stop the reaction.  With conventional combustion, it&amp;#39;s the opposite: the combustion of the fuel requires actively combining a fuel and an oxidizer (oxygen and a hydrocarbon generally).  There is no need to slow down the combustion for a given unit of fuel - a given unit of fuel will burn completely.  But there is an &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; way to slow down or stop the reactor: stop adding either fuel or oxidizer (usually both).&lt;/p&gt;

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field.

I just published a paper in Nature Biotechnology entitled ""[Genomic and phenotypic analyses of six offspring of a genome-edited hornless bull](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0266-0)"". For the past two years, my laboratory and collaborators have been studying six offspring of a dairy bull, genome-edited to prevent it from growing horns. This technology has been proposed as an alternative to dehorning, a common management practice performed to protect other cattle and human handlers from injuries. We found that none of the bull's offspring developed horns, as expected, and blood work and physical exams of the calves found they were all healthy. We also sequenced the genomes of the calves and their parents and analyzed these genomic sequences. Our study found that two calves inherited the naturally-occurring hornless allele, and four calves additionally inherited a fragment of bacterial DNA, known as a plasmid. This study has generated some media interest, and I am here to answer questions about the study, and genome editing more generally.

On a personal note I'm originally from Australia where I completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at The University of Melbourne, before completing my Masters and Ph.D. in Genetics at UC Davis. I have now lived in California for over 30 years with my husband who is a reproductive biologist studying white sturgeon. We are therefore ""surf and turf"", and also parents of two college-age boys.  The website for my research is https://animalbiotech.ucdavis.edu/. You can follow me on Twitter @BioBeef.

&lt;p&gt;On a personal note I&amp;#39;m originally from Australia where I completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at The University of Melbourne, before completing my Masters and Ph.D. in Genetics at UC Davis. I have now lived in California for over 30 years with my husband who is a reproductive biologist studying white sturgeon. We are therefore &amp;quot;surf and turf&amp;quot;, and also parents of two college-age boys.  The website for my research is &lt;a href=""https://animalbiotech.ucdavis.edu/""&gt;https://animalbiotech.ucdavis.edu/&lt;/a&gt;. You can follow me on Twitter @BioBeef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be online at 11am Pacific Time (2PM ET, 18 UT) on Friday October 11 to answer your questions. AMA!&lt;/p&gt;
