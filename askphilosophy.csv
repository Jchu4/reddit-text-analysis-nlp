#The Purpose of /r/askphilosophy

/r/askphilosophy aims to provide serious, well-researched answers to philosophical questions. We envision this subreddit as the philosophical counterpart to /r/AskHistorians, which is well-known for its high quality answers to historical questions.

/r/askphilosophy is thus a place to ask and answer philosophical questions. **/r/askphilosophy is not a debate or discussion subreddit.**

###Questions on /r/askphilosophy should be:

* Distinctly philosophical (i.e. not merely tangentially related to philosophy)

* Specific enough to be reasonably be answered (i.e. not extremely broad to the point of unanswerability)

* Posed in good faith (i.e. not posed for an agenda)

* Questions about philosophy, e.g. arguments in philosophy, philosophers' positions, the state of the field (not questions about commenters' opinions)

###Answers on /r/askphilosophy should be:

* Substantive and well-researched (i.e. not one-liners or otherwise uninformative)

* Accurately portray the state of research and literature (i.e. not inaccurate or false)

* Come only from those with relevant knowledge of the question (i.e. not from commenters who don't understand the state of the research on the question)

###Comments other than answers on /r/askphilosophy should be one of the following:

* Follow-up questions related to the OP's question

* Follow-up questions to a particular answer

* Discussion of the accuracy of a particular answer

* Thanks, gratitude, etc. for a particular answer.

All other comments are off-topic and will be removed.

#Rules

###Posting Rules

1. All questions must be about philosophy. Questions which are only tangentially related to philosophy or are properly located in another discipline will be removed. Questions which are about therapy, psychology and self-help, even when due to philosophical issues, are not appropriate and will be removed.

2. All submissions must be actual questions (as opposed to essays, rants, personal musings, idle or rhetorical questions, etc.). ""Test My Theory"" or ""Change My View""-esque questions, paper editing, etc. are not allowed.

3. Post titles must be descriptive. Titles should indicate what the question is about. Posts with titles like ""Homework help"" which do not indicate what the actual question is will be removed.

4. Questions must be reasonably specific. Questions which are too broad to the point of unanswerability will be removed.

5. Questions must not be about commenters' personal opinions, thoughts or favorites. /r/askphilosophy is not a discussion subreddit, and is not intended to be a board for everyone to share their thoughts on philosophical questions.

6. One post per day. Please limit yourself to one question per day.

7. Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit /r/suicidewatch. See also a discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth). Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden.

###Commenting Rules

1. All top level comments should be answers to the submitted question, or follow-up questions related to the OP. All comments must be on topic. If a follow-up question is deemed to be too unrelated from the OP, it may be removed.

2. All answers must be informed and aimed at helping the OP and other readers reach an understanding of the issues at hand. Answers must portray an accurate picture of the issue and the philosophical literature. Answers should be reasonably substantive. 

3. Be respectful. Comments which are rude, snarky, etc. may be removed, particularly if they consist of personal attacks. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Racism, bigotry and use of slurs are absolutely not permitted.

4. Stay on topic. Comments which blatantly do not contribute to the discussion may be removed.

5. Frequent commenters should become panelists and request flair. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/flair) for more information on becoming a panelist.

#Flair Guidelines

###The Purpose of Flair

After some discussion and a few challenging flair request cases, we are significantly revising the way in which we label panelists in the hopes of making flair more clearly communicate certain sorts of panelist expertise.

But first, a reminder of the purpose of flairs on /r/askphilosophy. Unlike in some subreddits, the purpose of flairs on /r/askphilosophy are not to designate commenters' areas of interest. The purpose of flair is to indicate commenters' relevant expertise in philosophical areas and research. As philosophical issues are often complicated and have potentially thousands of years of research to sift through, knowing when someone is an expert in a given area can be important in helping understand and weigh the given evidence.

###Who Qualifies for Flair

Given this understanding, **flair will only be given to those with research expertise in some area of philosophy**. Flair is not simply for those interested in a given area or topic, but rather for those who have studied it intensively and are qualified and prepared to provide well-researched and developed answers to questions.

###Flair Areas

Further, flair will be given only in particular areas or research topics in philosophy. Typical areas include things like ""philosophy of mind"", ""logic"", ""continental philosophy"". Flair will not be granted for specific research subjects, e.g. ""Kant on logic"", ""metaphysical grounding"", ""epistemic modals"". Flair of specific philosophers will only be granted if that philosopher is clearly and uncontroversially a monumentally important philosopher, e.g. Confucius, Kant, Nietzsche.

Flair will be given in a maximum of three areas.

###The Varieties of Flair

Previously, there was some confusion about the scope and difference between graduate and professional flair, and some reasoned disagreement about what sorts of academics might appropriately be understood to be experts about certain philosophical topics. As such, we have fully redesigned our flair guidelines and increased the types of flair to better respond to the various ways in which people develop their expertise and the various stages of that development which they find themselves in. The names of some of the categories remain the same, but their scope is slightly different to accommodate two new panelist areas.

* **Autodidact** - The panelist has little or no formal education in philosophy, but is an enthusiastic self-educator and intense reader in a field.

* **Undergraduate** - The panelist is enrolled in or has completed formal undergraduate coursework in Philosophy. In the US system, for instance, this would be indicated by a major (BA) or minor.

* **Graduate** - The panelist is enrolled in a graduate program or has completed an MA in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their coursework might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a degree in Philosophy. For example, a student with an MA in Literature whose coursework and thesis were focused on Derrida's deconstruction might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to an MA in Philosophy.

* **PhD** - The panelist has completed a PhD program in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their degree might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in Philosophy. For example, a student with a PhD in Art History whose coursework and dissertation focused on aesthetics and critical theory might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in philosophy.

* **Professional** - The panelist derives their full-time employment through philosophical work outside of academia. Such panelists might include Bioethicists working in hospitals, Lawyers who work on the Philosophy of Law, Ontologists, etc.

* **Related Field** - The panelist has expertise in some sub-field of philosophy but their work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy. For example, a PhD in Physics whose research touches on issues relating to the entity/structural realism debate clearly has expertise relevant to philosophical issues but is reasonably understood to be working primarily in another field.

These new divisions aim primarily at two things: (1) more clearly communicating the kind of expertise held by panelists and (2) streamlining a few troublesome aspects of the flair application process.

###Updating Your Flair

Since some of these changes involve carving up old flair categories, some re-categorizations of panelists may be required. In order to make this as simple as possible, the flair conversion will go as follows for each respective, current flair category:

* Current Autodidact flair holders (grey) remain as they are.

* Current Undergraduate flair holders (red) remain as they are.

* Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who do not hold PhDs in Philosophy or hold an equivalent PhD remain as they are.

* Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work inside academia remain as they are. This flair category will be renamed ""PhD.""

The following types of panelists should message moderators for a change in flair color:

* Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who have completed a PhD in Philosophy or hold a PhD which is equivalent to a PhD in philosophy (as described above) should ask for a ""PhD"" flair.

* Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who are active students or have completed just an MA in a related field but whose work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy should ask for a ""Related Field"" (green) flair.

* Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work in in a related field but whose work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy should ask for a ""Related Field"" (green) flair.

* Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work outside of academia should ask for a new ""Pro"" (blue) flair.

As always, panelists who could qualify for more than one type of flair are welcome to choose how to represent themselves. In making this choice, panelists should at least try to represent their expertise in a way that will match how they tend to answer questions in the sub.

If you are not sure whether or not you should be re-classified, then message the moderators and we will help sort out your flair.

###Requesting Flair

Frequent commenters should become panelists and request flair, pursuant to the above flair guidelines. To request flair, please send a message to the moderators via modmail with the subject 'Flair Request for /r/askphilosophy', detailing which flair you are requesting and why. All flair requests should contain:

* The flair type you are requesting (e.g. undergraduate, PhD, related field).

* The areas of flair you are requesting, up to 3 (e.g. Kant, continental philosophy, logic).

* A brief explanation of your background in philosophy, including what qualifies you for the flair you requested.

/r/askphilosophy **does not require users to provide proof of their identifies for flair requests, nor to reveal their identities. There is thus an expectation that all frequent commenters will become panelists and request flair.**

#Open Discussion Threads

Each week /r/askphilosophy has an ""Open Discussion Thread"" (ODT), which is posted once a week and stickied to the top of the subreddit. These threads are a place for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but wouldn't necessarily meet our posting rules. For example, these threads are great places for:

* Personal opinion questions, e.g. ""who is your favourite philosopher?""

* ""Test My Theory"" discussions and argument/paper editing

* ""Change My View"" style discussions

* Discussion not necessarily related to any particular question, e.g. about what you're currently reading

* Questions about academic philosophy

* Questions about therapy, psychology or self-help, e.g. ""How do I deal with determinism?""

We hope that the ODTs provide a venue for the /r/askphilosophy community to engage in the types of discussion which do not formally meet our rules, but with and within the excellent community of /r/askphilosophy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we are going live with a new set of rules and guidelines which we hope will clarify our vision for &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; and help improve this community going forward.

&lt;p&gt;The following types of panelists should message moderators for a change in flair color:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who have completed a PhD in Philosophy or hold a PhD which is equivalent to a PhD in philosophy (as described above) should ask for a &amp;quot;PhD&amp;quot; flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who are active students or have completed just an MA in a related field but whose work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy should ask for a &amp;quot;Related Field&amp;quot; (green) flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Requesting Flair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequent commenters should become panelists and request flair, pursuant to the above flair guidelines. To request flair, please send a message to the moderators via modmail with the subject &amp;#39;Flair Request for &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;, detailing which flair you are requesting and why. All flair requests should contain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flair type you are requesting (e.g. undergraduate, PhD, related field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The areas of flair you are requesting, up to 3 (e.g. Kant, continental philosophy, logic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Open Discussion Threads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; has an &amp;quot;Open Discussion Thread&amp;quot; (ODT), which is posted once a week and stickied to the top of the subreddit. These threads are a place for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily meet our posting rules. For example, these threads are great places for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal opinion questions, e.g. &amp;quot;who is your favourite philosopher?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Test My Theory&amp;quot; discussions and argument/paper editing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Change My View&amp;quot; style discussions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion not necessarily related to any particular question, e.g. about what you&amp;#39;re currently reading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about academic philosophy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about therapy, psychology or self-help, e.g. &amp;quot;How do I deal with determinism?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that the ODTs provide a venue for the &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; community to engage in the types of discussion which do not formally meet our rules, but with and within the excellent community of &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

P.S. The most common critique of his philosophy that I see often is something like *""JBP uses an inaccurate terminology of 'postmodern Neo-Marxist', and that is a contradiction""*.

The best way to view the world if you're a Marxist is through the lens of oppressed and oppressor. Now, the funny thing about that is that if you're a post-modernist is that that's actually an interpretation, right? It's a Marxist interpretation. And the interpretation is that the best way to look at the world is through the lens of oppressor versus oppressed, but if you're a post-modernist you don't get to have a canonical interpretation 'cause your whole damn theory is predicated on the notion that you don't get to have a canonical interpretation because no interpretation is better than any other interpretation.""* ([12:00 minute mark)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rUPatnXSE)

So if no one is causa sui and therefore lacks freedom, how does this fact, or how should it, influence our daily behavior? Don’t all of us hard determinist philosophers still live as though we were free? If this is the case, then doesn’t free will exist in some sense, even if it’s not an ultimate, metaphysical sense? And if it is a metaphysical illusion, is there anything on the other side of the illusion?

All said, though, it seems like every event in the universe, including our own psychological events, are preceded by a chain of causes over which we had no control. So if no one is causa sui and therefore lacks freedom, how does this fact, or how should it, influence our daily behavior? Don’t all of us hard determinist philosophers still live as though we were free? If this is the case, then doesn’t free will exist in some sense, even if it’s not an ultimate, metaphysical sense? And if it is a metaphysical illusion, is there anything on the other side of the illusion?

In short, my reasoning results from how we come to make beliefs and what we deem moral agents.  We can start with Socrates, as he provides arguments for what wisdom is.  Now many of us know his famous quote, ""the unexamined life is not worth living"".  Not reflecting on the rules or beliefs is a false sense of knowledge, operating mechanically like an animal or plant.  We wouldn't hold a lion as a moral agent because it does not partake in higher thinking.  A lion killing another lion to assert dominance over a pride is much different than a human man killing a married man in order to mate with his wife!

John Dewey creates a modern evolution of this that I think puts this quite eloquently.  In ""What is Thought"", he describes two types of thinking: (1) Beliefs that are accepted when their grounds have not themselves been considered. and (2) Beliefs that are accepted because their grounds have been examined.  For (1), we recognize that this type of thinking is a type of bias or prejudice and is unreflective.  Surely though, we hold people who form beliefs under both types of thinking as moral agents with the burden of the human mind.  

Yet from Socrates position, it seems as though we ought to always, within practicality, be reflective (type 2) thinkers.  In fact, under Socrates's position, what separates those who are type 1 thinkers from animals?  In ""Apology"", Socrates is said to have met with an Oracle he deemed him the wisest person, something he struggled with.  Yet he continually saw very few people were reflective thinkers.  If he, or someone like him, were to do wrong, it stands to reason that Socrates would believe this person is more morally culpable than a sophist or someone with false wisdom.

I could continue on and on, progressing through the history of philosophy with this question.  If a kantian ethicist were to violate a strict categorical imperative, are they more culpable than someone who commits the same wrong but has not training of ethics?  Or a strict Utilitarian who does something for his or her own good over the good of society?

Now I'm not proposing that Philosophers be jailed for extra time because they are more reflective thinkers, but can we argue that at least for an internal reflection an Philosopher Ethicist may be committing a greater wrong even when the action is the same of someone who is, for simplicity's sake, ignorant?

I'm not a law expert, but culpability and punishment of crime (at least in the U.S) is based on mental states and cognition.  Intentionally, knowingly, negligently, and recklessly are the usual mental states it seems from cursory research.  We hold those who know a bit more than others more accountable.  Does this mean we can hold people who know greater knowledge more accountable?

Is there any decision a parent should *not* make on behalf of their child?

At first, I thought there are a few things a parent should not decide: their child's occupation, spouse, and what wallpaper color their child should have in their adult home. Of course, these choices would interfere with their child's autonomy as an adult. If it were possible, legally, to sign a contract for your 14 year old child to work as a busboy for 40 years at a Denny's, it would seem that you ought not to, for your child should decided for themselves what they should do and where they should work past 18 years. The same could be said for marriage: your child, once they turn 18, ought to be able to decide whom they should marry themselves, and if they were already locked in a previous marriage their ability to do so would be hampered; eliminated, even, if divorce was illegal. 

It seems duration makes a decision one a parent should leave to their child. If the decision is lasting such that it carries on past the age of consent, then it interferes with your child's autonomy as an adult. The following example seems to illustrate this *at first.* Let's assume one has a right  to raise your child as whatever religion one wishes. It would seem, however, that even if one has this right, one does not have the right to brainwash their child such that they cannot choose a different religion once they turn 18, for then this would interfere with their ability to choose a religion as an adult, as the brainwashing has lasting consequences. 

However (and this is where I'm confused), every decision I mentioned in the beginning paragraph and even the example of religion have lasting consequences, longer than if the individual is 18, but this don't seem like decisions a parent shouldn't make for their child at all.  I suppose they aren't irreversible in the way a legal contract or brainwashing are, but one can hardly, for example, choose to forget a second language entirely. Yet does an adult not have the right to choose what languages they know? Or only what languages they learn from 18 on?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents make decisions on behalf of their children all the time: what instruments to learn to play, what sport to play, whether or not to enroll in a dual -language immersion program or not, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any decision a parent should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make on behalf of their child?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought there are a few things a parent should not decide: their child&amp;#39;s occupation, spouse, and what wallpaper color their child should have in their adult home. Of course, these choices would interfere with their child&amp;#39;s autonomy as an adult.

I can provide necessary background if you haven't read the book but are still inclined to take a pass at it.  It is one of two arguments given in critique of logical positivist (esp. Carnap's) notions of the relationship between formal models and the empirical phenomenon to be modelled, in the book he makes substantial use of the analogy between how a mathematical logician models an algebraic structure (= syntactic rather than semantic for the purposes of this passage) with a set to which it applies (he sees this as much like scientific experimentation, = the semantic for the purposes of this passage), and the process of modelling in scientific contexts.  This passage immediately follows a discussion about how there are substantial mathematical relations between the syntactic and semantic, namely, a structure is consistent iff it has a model, a structure is complete iff it has only one model, and how this relationship is not one of logic and structure having strict precedence over the mathematical or intuitive, since basic mathematics is used in reasoning about structures.  

My impression is in the part right before this he's attempting to say that since it is evident that this opposition is overcome in the relationship between structure and model in mathematics, which is the inspiration for the scientific analogy, that we should expect (perhaps) similar instability in the related analogy between a formal model and the empirical facts it is meant to capture.  I think I get that, but this passage seems to be moving on to a new but related point towards the end of the paragraph.

&gt;  
&gt;There were also translations of the *Meno* and the *Phaedo* made in the twelfth century by a certain Henry Aristippus of Catania,\[[8](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-philosophy/notes.html#note-8)\] but almost no one appears to have read them. They seem to have had only a modest circulation and absolutely no influence at all to speak of.\[[9](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-philosophy/notes.html#note-9)\]  
&gt;  
&gt;There had been a few other Latin translations made even much earlier, but these vanished from circulation before the Middle Ages got very far along. Cicero himself had translated the *Protagoras* and a small part of the *Timaeus*, and in the second century Apuleius translated the *Phaedo*, but these translations disappeared after the sixth century and had very little effect on anyone (Klibansky \[1982\], pp. 21–22). As Saint Jerome remarks in the late-fourth or early-fifth century, in his *Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians*, “How many people know Plato’s books, or his name? Idle old men on the corners hardly recall him” (Migne \[1844–64\], vol. 26, col. 401B).  
&gt;  
&gt;This state of affairs lasted until the Renaissance, when Marsilio Ficino (1433–99) translated and commented on the complete works of Plato. Thus, except for roughly the first half of the *Timaeus*, the Middle Ages did not know the actual texts of Plato.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for Plotinus, matters were even worse. His *Enneads* (the collection of his writings) were almost completely unavailable. Marius Victorinus is said to have translated some of the *Enneads* into Latin in the fourth century, but his translation, if in fact it really existed, seems to have been lost soon afterwards

The problem I have with this, is that if it is true that your consciousness is new constantly, or resets after a specific time, how can we prove that we exist at all? This may sound very similar to Solipsism, and I guess that in a way, it is, but instead of the absence of other existent life forms, the absence is of other existence of yourself.

If the case is that you only are truly experiencing only what is happening in the moment, than what is the point of preparing anything for the future? Should I not be living just to feel pleasure in the moment?

In some ways, I can see this being similar to the Ship of Theseus. If my consciousness is swapped out of my body for a new consciousness every second, then is my body the definition of who I am???

I would argue that in the end, it does not matter, as we should live life as we have for all time up until the question has been proposed, but unfortunately it almost feels like an infohazard, in that when you say ""I should go back to this"" your brain immediately says ""Ah, but who can say if that really was?""

&lt;p&gt;An example was someone not appropriately addressing the sadness and emotional toil of their depression because they know that people suffered more than them during the Great Depression or in Nazi concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;

But what does this mean? This label can be defined in many ways, and used to describe very different concepts. Because of this, as well as **another thing to do with Rawls** (which I will mention), I am kind of confused about his views and everyone’s views. In order to understand his actual position on “social justice”, I would like a few things which I will address to be clarified/corrected, which I will get into through various sections.

The **first** (section) I will talk how Rawls uses this term in the more literal and basic sense of it – the appropriate framework or basic structure of society in which primary social goods (universal instruments of value; i.e. while there are a plurality of ends, no matter your ends, you need more freedoms, opportunities and wealth to achieve them, as opposed to less) are assigned or administered under social cooperation.

The **second** thing I’d like to mention is actually what the Difference Principle means. The basic idea is to maximise the minimum share. A little more specifically, Rawls’s idea of what kind of fundamental rules should be made behind the veil of ignorance is that institutional arrangements should be such that it maximises the absolute position of the least advantaged in society (not concerned with relative position). I will ask about what Rawls is actually saying here; to what extent is his theory ‘distributive’ (what does that mean?) Does he want to impose “patterns” as Nozick claims? This needs to be clarified, as everything else which follows may or may not be based on a false premise.

**Third**, Hayek agrees with Rawls if by “social justice” he means that there is a need to establish principles of how resources should be allocated. And he sees some legitimacy of the state supporting those who can't support themselves in the market, and provide the minimum income for basic survival. What does he disagree with Rawls on? This will lie on what Rawls actually says (.e. the second section), because a lot of Hayek’s work is a critique of central planning, but I don’t believe Rawls is advocating for specific end-states or outcomes to occur

**SECTION 1: SOCIAL JUSTICE AS RULES OF SOCIAL COOPERATION**

We must start off with some basic political philosophy, which starts with the (almost universally shared) assumption that there is a common vested interest in living in a society, as opposed to a prosocial state of nature. By living under social cooperation, there is a level of assurance or certainty that one can work towards the future. I think Hobbes said that without this, there is no art, architecture – literally nothing; because people would not feel secure enough to invest in their own fruits of labour. So if people are to live together in a society, where we can safely invest into the future, we need theories of justice to make this possible.

Basically the key thing to consider is the role of resources. People have different values of the good. We have different goals in life, and there is no cardinal scale to measure which goals are “better”. But what we can say is that everyone want resources, and the more the better. Whether you want to be a lawyer or go into architecture, you’ll need more rights as opposed to less rights, more opportunities as opposed to less opportunities, and more wealth as opposed to less wealth. These are specifically primary social goods which are to be administered by social institutions. And so the question lies on the arrangement of such institutions in allocating these universal instruments of value in a particular way.

It is said that Rawls uses “social justice” in this way, which Hayek agrees on. I will now like to go over Rawls’ different principle as one theory of (social) justice.

**SECTION 2: RAWLS’S DIFFERENCE PRINCIPLE**

One of Rawls’s key ideas is that social and economic arrangements should be such that there is a greater benefit to the least advantaged. Consider the following: for Arrangement 1 (A1), the top share has $100 and the bottom share has $5. Arrangement 2 (A2), the top has $200 and the bottom has $2. If one was to design society from the original position, the different principle says to take A1 as a matter of risk. In other words, you’re better off being a Muslim in the US than an Atheist in Saudi Arabia.

I don’t think Rawls is imposing particular patterns here, or is he? The original position is obviously hypothetical, and Rawls does not advocate specific policies, because that cannot be determined behind the veil of ignorance. One only has general knowledge of political theory, economics, law, etc. but not specific situations. Rawls speaks of the least advantaged in terms of social positions, and not the specific groups which fill them. Take the above example; the “least advantaged” (for the purposes of this post) social positions in USA and Saudi Arabia are different types of people, but are both “disadvantaged” in their societies. Thus, the people in this category will change.

The question then is, to what extent is this imposing patterns, and to what extent does this entail government intervention? Nozick said in pretty much a direct response to Rawls that liberty upsets patterns. But is Nozick’s understanding of Rawls the same as Rawls’s understanding of his own views? What is the Wilt Chamberlain trying to illustrate here? Every person in any end of the political spectrum is looking to promote equal opportunities. The problem is what that means? I feel people of the right think that the Left want “equal outcomes, not equal opportunity” which is a strawman. No one is saying that, and that’s a bit lazy. Is that the equivalent of what Nozick thinks of Rawls? I’d like to know Rawls’s actual views here.

Next, I will talk about Hayek’s understanding of Rawls, his take on the term “social justice” in general, and what he opposes it (whatever it means).

**SECTION 3: HAYEK**

Hayek doesn’t like redistribution where there are markets and spontaneous order. Morally speaking, he says it uses the government to “coerce” those who were able to exchange in the market to those who could not – especially theft. Practically, he says it messes up the price signals, which are an expression of the plurality of ends, due to knowledge of this nature being dispersed. The role of the state is to secure the conditions under which individuals have the opportunities pursuing their own goals, and not stating the preferred ends.

At the same time, he does see the need for provided a kind of safety net as a minimum threshold before going into the market to open opportunities. But where is the line between just leveling the playing field and coercing other people? Hayek agrees that ""social justice"", as the need to establish the appropriate institutional arrangement in society to allow people to pursuing their vision of the good, is necessary. So where does his infamous quote come from?

His critique of “social justice” seems to imply that advocates of this label want to impose a certain end-state of resource distribution that is “just”. This assumes that markets operate under a zero-sum game. That the result of the market arose from people getting more wealth by denying that of another. Hayek says that to apply a moral dimension to markets makes no sense; justice speaks of a direct human action. However, society is not a single entity; it is the collection of individuals pursuing their own ends and bumping into each other. Thus, the results of market activities are amoral; you cannot pinpoint a perpetrator as one is only responsible for their own ends (mutual disinterest). Only if a given transaction itself is involuntary, can language of morality come into conversation. Thus, “social justice” as prescribing patterns would be “injustice”, as intervention would be seen as arbitrary if no one did anything wrong.

Does Hayek think this is what Rawls says? And of course, what does Rawls really say? (something I keep reinforcing in this post) You can’t call Rawls an advocate for central planning, but there is some level of government intervention perhaps? So what is Hayek’s problem with “social justice”, his disagreement with Rawls, and is this justified?

**SECTION 4: CONCLUDING THOUGHTS**

Overall, I am confused about the different critiques of social justice, because I am not sure if people are actually responding to the actual arguments, and what these arguments are. Hayek and Rawls are seen as in different ends of the political spectrum, so Hayek must see some element of what he thinks “social justice” means in Rawls (even if Rawls uses that term for something else). Is this deserved? The term “social justice” is kept being thrown around, but used for different purposes in different contexts. There is clearly a huge problem with semantics, and makes this whole thing puzzling.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayek once said that “social justice” is a mirage. But what does this mean? This label can be defined in many ways, and used to describe very different concepts. Because of this, as well as &lt;strong&gt;another thing to do with Rawls&lt;/strong&gt; (which I will mention), I am kind of confused about his views and everyone’s views. In order to understand his actual position on “social justice”, I would like a few things which I will address to be clarified/corrected, which I will get into through various sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; (section) I will talk how Rawls uses this term in the more literal and basic sense of it – the appropriate framework or basic structure of society in which primary social goods (universal instruments of value; i.e. while there are a plurality of ends, no matter your ends, you need more freedoms, opportunities and wealth to achieve them, as opposed to less) are assigned or administered under social cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;second&lt;/strong&gt; thing I’d like to mention is actually what the Difference Principle means. The basic idea is to maximise the minimum share. A little more specifically, Rawls’s idea of what kind of fundamental rules should be made behind the veil of ignorance is that institutional arrangements should be such that it maximises the absolute position of the least advantaged in society (not concerned with relative position). I will ask about what Rawls is actually saying here; to what extent is his theory ‘distributive’ (what does that mean?) Does he want to impose “patterns” as Nozick claims? This needs to be clarified, as everything else which follows may or may not be based on a false premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt;, Hayek agrees with Rawls if by “social justice” he means that there is a need to establish principles of how resources should be allocated. And he sees some legitimacy of the state supporting those who can&amp;#39;t support themselves in the market, and provide the minimum income for basic survival. What does he disagree with Rawls on? This will lie on what Rawls actually says (.e. the second section), because a lot of Hayek’s work is a critique of central planning, but I don’t believe Rawls is advocating for specific end-states or outcomes to occur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECTION 1: SOCIAL JUSTICE AS RULES OF SOCIAL COOPERATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must start off with some basic political philosophy, which starts with the (almost universally shared) assumption that there is a common vested interest in living in a society, as opposed to a prosocial state of nature. By living under social cooperation, there is a level of assurance or certainty that one can work towards the future. I think Hobbes said that without this, there is no art, architecture – literally nothing; because people would not feel secure enough to invest in their own fruits of labour. So if people are to live together in a society, where we can safely invest into the future, we need theories of justice to make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the key thing to consider is the role of resources. People have different values of the good. We have different goals in life, and there is no cardinal scale to measure which goals are “better”. But what we can say is that everyone want resources, and the more the better. Whether you want to be a lawyer or go into architecture, you’ll need more rights as opposed to less rights, more opportunities as opposed to less opportunities, and more wealth as opposed to less wealth. These are specifically primary social goods which are to be administered by social institutions. And so the question lies on the arrangement of such institutions in allocating these universal instruments of value in a particular way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said that Rawls uses “social justice” in this way, which Hayek agrees on. I will now like to go over Rawls’ different principle as one theory of (social) justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECTION 2: RAWLS’S DIFFERENCE PRINCIPLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Rawls’s key ideas is that social and economic arrangements should be such that there is a greater benefit to the least advantaged. Consider the following: for Arrangement 1 (A1), the top share has $100 and the bottom share has $5. Arrangement 2 (A2), the top has $200 and the bottom has $2. If one was to design society from the original position, the different principle says to take A1 as a matter of risk. In other words, you’re better off being a Muslim in the US than an Atheist in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Rawls is imposing particular patterns here, or is he? The original position is obviously hypothetical, and Rawls does not advocate specific policies, because that cannot be determined behind the veil of ignorance. One only has general knowledge of political theory, economics, law, etc. but not specific situations. Rawls speaks of the least advantaged in terms of social positions, and not the specific groups which fill them. Take the above example; the “least advantaged” (for the purposes of this post) social positions in USA and Saudi Arabia are different types of people, but are both “disadvantaged” in their societies. Thus, the people in this category will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question then is, to what extent is this imposing patterns, and to what extent does this entail government intervention? Nozick said in pretty much a direct response to Rawls that liberty upsets patterns. But is Nozick’s understanding of Rawls the same as Rawls’s understanding of his own views? What is the Wilt Chamberlain trying to illustrate here? Every person in any end of the political spectrum is looking to promote equal opportunities. The problem is what that means? I feel people of the right think that the Left want “equal outcomes, not equal opportunity” which is a strawman. No one is saying that, and that’s a bit lazy. Is that the equivalent of what Nozick thinks of Rawls? I’d like to know Rawls’s actual views here.&lt;/p&gt;

The first paradox is the one between absolute duty to the other and one's ethical duty. The second emerges when I choose to be responsible to an other, I am in effect failing to be responsible to all others.

Derrida invokes the Binding of Isaac where God tasks Abraham with sacrificing his son, Isaac. He suggests a paradox between responsibility and ethics in the narrative; in order to fulfill his absolute responsibility to God, Abraham must betray his ethical duty to his family in offering Isaac. Derrida notes that *""the absoluteness of duty, of responsibility, and of obligation certainly demands that one transgresses ethical duty, although in betraying it one still belongs to it and at the same time recognizes it""* (66). This is where I'm confused. In portraying the contradiction, is Abraham absolved of his ethical duties because of his responsibility to God? Or does Derrida simply problematize the entire idea of responsibility due to its ethical transgression?

Later in the chapter, Derrida brings up the idea that one fails their responsibility to all others by choosing to be responsible to one, where he adds *""And I can never justify this sacrifice, I must always hold my peace about it""* (71). Derrida brings up an analogy of cats, *""How would you ever justify the fact that you sacrifice all the cats in the world to the cat that you feed at home every day for years, whereas other cats die of hunger at every instant""* (71). This made me feel slightly uncomfortable. To me, it seems like I should continue to rank my responsibility to the Other that I am face to face with. Using Derrida's cat analogy, I acknowledge that by adopting and feeding a cat I am failing to be responsible to all other cats, which is unjustifiable but that's okay.

I know this was pretty long, I hope you guys can help me better understand Derrida for my literature class presentation. Thanks!

But by the time the scientist knows the voter is going for A, it's too late. The voter has already made up their mind to go for A. 

So in order for the scientist to ensure the voter goes for B, the scientist would have to preempt any decision toward A, which means the scientist would have to activate the chip before the voter was even thinking about who to vote for.

I've been working on a philosophical essay as a sort or personal project. I'm being very humble about it and so far I've written about 8 pages, which have been edited by two different philosophy PhDs (one studied plain philosophy from major to PhD, the other one studied political science, then a masters in philosophy and then a PhD in aesthetics).

I am an international relations student and I know that I do not have what it takes to write solid philosophy. This is because I recognize I'm still forming the ways in which I reason things.

However, I've poured a bit of work into this project and, as I mentioned, It's been edited. I want to see if it is up to scratch but I don't know where I can get opinions on it. More than anything I'm just looking for spaces where I may get criticism or opinions on the theories I propose.

The text is not very innovative and it doesn't attempt to do much. So far, it is only an attempt at demonstrating the (in)validity of different forms of knowledge, contrasting science, religion and mysticism/magical thought. My thesis is an argument towards infinity to prove that the bases of each knowledge system are flawed in simple ways, and I use that as proof of my claim that a good criteria for choosing a knowledge system is whether it makes life experientially better or not.

The whole deconstructing+reconstructing arguments makes no sense to me. Every time I do it the way I think is right, I’m told I’m wrong and need to do x instead of y. I’m trying to be open minded, but philosophy seems like debating questions that have no definite answer for eternity.

Why do I need to understand the different feelings and emotions and forms of happiness? Why can’t I just be happy in peace without having to question every single thing ever? Is this too rant-ish? 

I don’t really else know what to say other than I get so frustrated because I understand it conceptually, but once stuff like modos ponnens and modos tonnens (is this right?) gets added in along with other stuff, I get lost.

I'll try and list what my thought proccess is and I'm hoping that someone who knows what they're talking about can tell me where I'm wrong/what I'm missing.

1: Naturalism (as it related to meta ethics) is the view that moral evil and goodness are facts of the natural world, much like facts of science. I. e, not from one's point of view and doesn't change based on perspective. (to me this seems like an assertion that moral evil and goodness have some sort of metaphysical existence independent of human thought but this doesn't seem to line up with what any of the thinkers are arguing)

2: F.H. Bradley, Philipa Foot and J.L. Mackie are all Naturalist philosophers

Bradley: Morals can be deduced by considering the moral tradition of one's country, one's place in society and one's specific situation - and the logical conclusion that can be drawn from considering these factors defines what *is* moral in an absolute sense. My take on this is that it's Bradley's view that moral rules are absolutely right or wrong for one person in one situation but this doesn't necessarily apply to other people in other situations. My qualm with this is why the logical conclusion of considering all of the elements of a situation is inherently good/bad? While it could mean that a good system is devised that may well be the best for us to all agree on it still doesn't answer the question of why the conclusions are absolute ""from the point of view of the universe"" - surely it just means that this is a way that we can create a good moral system? Am I missing something or is this just something that Bradley doesn't consider that someone like Ayer or Moore already has a criticism of?

Foot: In many ways I have the same issue. She argued that immoral acts are a natural defect in the same way that an oak tree having shit roots that can't support it very well is a natural defect. While we could label that as defected, in and of itself how is it a defect? Surely it only becomes a defect once we start arguing that it's better for an oak tree to be sturdy than not - meaning that there's nothing inherent or absolute about it and it's a human value judgement that is made? Again, was this just overlooked by Foot or am I missing a trick here?

Mackie: I've actually started reading his book ""Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong"" and one of the first things he says is that morality isn't absolute. It's his argument that while things aren't right or wrong in an absolute sense, things can be absolutely right or wrong from the point of view of an institution - like in the sense of chess ""you can't move your rook because it's pinned to your king"" is an absolute rule for chess but I could still decide to throw the rook accross the room. It's from this that he argues that moral rules are based on tradition rather than any absolute metaphysical reality of morals, but again - surely this just isn't naturalism as it requires humans to come up with the rules?

My textbook says that these are all naturalist points of view but naturalism proposes that morals are absolute facts, when it seems to me that these philosophers aren't actually proposing any absolute moral facts and are rather proposing ways to create the best kinds of morals. Do I just have the definition wrong, do I have the thinker's views wrong or am I just missing/assuming something that I shouldn't be?

I've been doing extensive reading on Schopenhauer today as preparation for an essay on his pessimistic views and I have come across two different bits of writing that seem to somewhat contradict themselves. I'd like to hear what others thoughts are on how the two are compatible in Schopenhauer's views, and what Schopenhauer would value more in regards to the present or the future.

Firstly:

""The present alone is true and actual; it is the only time which possesses full reality, and our existence lies in it exclusively. Therefore we should always be glad of it, and give it the welcome it deserves, and enjoy every hour that is bearable by its freedom from pain and annoyance with a full consciousness of its value....It is the height of folly to refuse the present hour of happiness, or wantonly to spoil it by vexation at by-gones or uneasiness about what is to come.""

\-Counsels and Maxims, Section 5

So here he is praising a preferrence for the moment, although he does mention 'consciousness of its value' so that could be interpreted as a realisation of its impact on the future. Although does Schopenhauer value the future or the present more? Epistemically he states only the present is true and actual, and Schopenhauer himself states a preference for 'the true nature of the world' although this quote isnt exactly directly relevant (would like to know if anyone has a more relevant one).

Then secondly, in chapter XVI 'On the Practical use of our Reason and Stoicism' in The World as Will and Representation

“With him, therefore, the future is always borrowing from the present instead of the present from the future as in the case of the frivolous fool, who thus becomes impoverished and ultimately bankrupt”

Though here he begins to speak from the perspective of the Stoic and quotes Seneca and also Aristotle prior to saying this, he concludes with seemingly his own opinion with 'frivolous fool.' Given his appreciation for Buddhism ideals would one say Schopenhauer values the present more so than preparing for the future? His prerogative is ultimately avoiding pain, so would sacrificing the moment to avoid pain be a preference for Schopenhauer or would utilising the present to avoid pain be a higher incentive? He states 'Enjoy every hour that is bearable by its freedom from pain' but if one was to efficiently structure their existence to avoid pain as Schopenhauer claims we should, then as a result the present would have to seek pain. Furthermore we would have to refuse happiness, going against his statement, in order to receive exponential happiness as a result in the future. In my own opinion in evaluating the value of a moment, it seems sacrifing the present and thus actively and knowingly tending towards deliberate pain offers the ability to avoid monumental suffering in the future. In a way we experience memories of a moment much 'longer' than the brief passing by of it in its actual occurence. Personally, I look back on moments I was undeniably in suffering and anguish and almost perceive it fondly for what it resulted in for myself.

I just found these two quotes to create some ambiguity on what Schopenhauer would value more highly, the moment, or preparation for the future?

Interested to hear what people have to say,

Over the last few days I've been actively trying to understand Absurdism. To this end I've been reading Camus who I find very difficult but I love and Thomas Nagel (who is also brilliant) along with other random things I found online (wikipedia etc). And although I feel I somewhat intellectually get what the Absurd is about and what it means to say something like, life is absurd, I've nevertheless had a really hard time perceiving the absurd as an actual experience. I mean haven't been able to really experience the absurdity of human life.  And in trying to coax myself into seeing it, like trying to break the puzzle of a koan to gain instant enlightenment, I've been trying to understand if humans are ultimately irrational. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I mean by this is related to what I've been reading about from the absurdists. It seems one of the lines of evidence that leads someone to the absurd (as far as I understand Nagel) is that explanations and justifications must come to some kind of end somewhere because each thing needs something outside itself to justify it. If the chain of justifications does not end then this leads to infinite regress which provides no justification either.  But where it comes to an end is where we simply accept a way of living or thinking or being inclined towards one way or another. And this 'primal instinct'  about the core ways we do things is not something we question too much. Furthermore, if we question the ultimate end of the chain of explanations that is provided within any justification, we will not be able to provide yet another justification for that ultimate end point, and so we must accept that our acceptance of it is arbitrary. That the axioms at the root level simply appeal to us. They just strike our fancy and there's nothing more to be said about why we accept them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding is that this fact of being unable to provide a justification for the machinery that provides justifications exposes the total arbitrariness of everything we do. And although we can observe the arbitrariness we still act as if it's not there, creating the absurdity.....I think..like I said Im still trying to understand this. 

&amp;#x200B;

So finally. If it's the case that all of our rational logical arguments and all propositions that can ever be written down cannot ever be justified without arbitrarily picking one axiom schema over another then isn't every action we take ultimately irrational since any explanation for the action must end at appealing to faith in some thing or statement?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure if the question in the title accurately captures what I&amp;#39;m asking.

I’ve recently been wholly enwrapped in the question of “What is art” recently. I’ve read up a bit on some of the historical answers (of Plato and Tolstoy) - though I still seem to continue the quest of finding an answer for the unanswerable.

I think Tolstoy’s definition is the closest to what I feel to be true; though from the bits I’ve read, it only seems to address art at the conceptual level.

I’m attempting to fill some interpersonal compass that will let me look at something - ask, “is this art?”, and create my answer therefrom. 

For example, where I’m sat right now, I se a wooden door on a hospital-white wall, with an equally tall glass window next to it.

This door and window are not aesthetically intricate works of carpentry or architecture. I have no emotional connection to them whatsoever. I look at this excerpt of a building and, as a consumer, feel it not to be art – though the architect may feel otherwise.

However; were I to sit in front of it and sketch out an exact copy of my view onto paper (should I possess the ability), I would feel *inclined* by some internal definition to consider the drawing a piece of art.

——

Further – I saw in another thread from years ago that someone had poised a question. “Once you have decided that a thing is art; what can you do to make it *not* art?” (Paraphrased.)

These two questions have been breaking my brain for the past couple of weeks.

She later said she was unaware of the related Washington, D.C., controversy that had come to light the week before.

The controversy at the University of Wisconsin seems to be a great example of so many similar debates I've seen recently. This is my first time looking for academic answers to it because so far all I've heard is ""facts don't care about your feelings"" from the Shapiro fans and ""it makes me sad so you can't say it anymore"" from the other side. I'm hoping there's more to it than that.

What sort of perspectives can philosophy bring to this? Could you make something like a utilitarian argument and say that if the negative effects of using the word (in the above example) outweigh the positives then it is wrong? On the other hand, if the etymology of the word is explained to the student (in the above example) and they continue to be offended then have they not faulted in some way? Would the professor be right to state that they just need to develop their intellectual or academic maturity and then continue to repeatedly use the word despite the student being in a state of serious emotional distress? 

Both sides of this argument seem correct to me. Perhaps the issue is my want to choose one or the other.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_word_niggardly""&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_word_niggardly&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

I would really appreciate any answers from people here on this subreddit in either case.

So here is the problem: how do we decide when we should NOT act in philanthropic way and seek self gain in a situation? Where do we draw the line?

However, I don't want to hurt them by blatantly putting it in front of them.These favours only irritate me a little, not hurt substantially. Secondly, all these favours are small, however, it seemingly just motivates them to ask more of such favours. 

Whenever we make good friend(s), for a healthy relationship, we tend to keep aside our selfishness and act a little bit kind and cooperating. Being selfish is not going to bring us many good friends. Every person has a good side. To bring them to that side, we need to give them space and assurance that we are friendly and understand their needs. However, if we act too kind, it may reach a point where that person starts taking your kindness for weakness. And so, my question is: when do you realise you need to switch from being friendly to being selfish/blatant? What is the best possible way to do this? Any philosophical theories that explains such life situation?

On the off-chance I'm doing a poor job of explaining, I'll give a few examples of pragmatism using skepticism..

1. A person is presented with the choice to either believe in a deity or not believe in a deity. There is no evidence supporting the existence of this deity, and using Occam's Razor, it makes most logical sense to believe that the deity does not exist. However, the religion associated with the deity provides a sense of belonging and peace to the person, gives them a more optimistic outlook on life, gives them a set of cultures and traditions to abide by and identify with. Furthermore, the person's family believes in the deity, and it might cause interpersonal tension in the family to break with the associated religion. Although the nonexistence of the deity is (most likely) the truth, abiding by the truth is not useful to the person, and thus the person chooses to put blind faith in the deity.  

2. An interior decorator recommends a particular color for a room based on the furniture, but when the time to actually paint the room comes, the homeowner can't remember the exact color, so they pick the closed shade that they remember it being. There's just one issue: the homeowner is colorblind, and rather than picking a dark green, they pick a bright orange. After the painters are finished and all the furniture is moved back in, the homeowner invites you to check out the newly painted room, which looks awful. If you tell the homeowner that they used the wrong color, they will at the very least be embarrassed, and at the very most might spend money to repaint; however, if you act as if the walls are painted the correct color, the homeowner will feel a sense of accomplishment. You decide that although the walls are painted the wrong color, it is most beneficial to act as if there is no issue with the room.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my understanding of the two schools, skepticism rejects the idea of an objective reality, or at the very least, a reliably observable objective reality.

Not a philosopher here, so there's a chance my (presumably very basic) question doesn't even make sense... if it doesn't, an explanation of why (however brief) would be appreciated!

I'm looking for two terms that would distinguish between the following examples and others like them:

Mathematics is a human construct, but we can say that two plus two objectively equals four, correct? But 'two' as a standalone concept doesn't map to anything in nature; nor does addition, equivalence, or 'four'. We can say the statement is 'objectively true' because we defined the laws of mathematics such that they are true.

The laws of nature could be considered human constructs, but they attempt to describe something that isn't a human construct: so, arbitrarily, the three laws of thermodynamics appear to be objectively true, but not exactly because we defined the laws that way, but because of what we observe in reality.

So 'two plus two equals four' and 'the entropy of any isolated system always increases' are both, as far as I can tell, objectively true.... but they seem to be true in different ways.

I am a little confused with logic, even on its most basic level so I thought I would seek some help where it is often at its best:

1. Firstly is it possible to have an argument that consists of one premiss as long as it has a conclusion? e.g. 'John eats his cheese and makes friends with his charisma. Therefore John makes friends with his charisma' Is this valid? Is it really two premisses? If it is is the first premiss even necessary at all?
2. Is the sentence 'Cheese does not taste good.' An argument? Or would it just be considered a declarative sentence? If so can this be valid or invalid? Or is it neither?
3. The argument 'Dogs are Dogs. This follows from the fact that dogs woof' Is the premiss true but the argument invalid? Does that make the conclusion false?!
4. 'Dogs are Dogs. Thus, Dogs woof' This is invalid but is it consistent?!

Logic really confuses me, there is too many characterisations and definitions for different jargon. I hate it. Any help?

&lt;li&gt;Firstly is it possible to have an argument that consists of one premiss as long as it has a conclusion? e.g. &amp;#39;John eats his cheese and makes friends with his charisma. Therefore John makes friends with his charisma&amp;#39; Is this valid? Is it really two premisses? If it is is the first premiss even necessary at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the sentence &amp;#39;Cheese does not taste good.&amp;#39; An argument? Or would it just be considered a declarative sentence? If so can this be valid or invalid? Or is it neither?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The argument &amp;#39;Dogs are Dogs. This follows from the fact that dogs woof&amp;#39; Is the premiss true but the argument invalid? Does that make the conclusion false?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#39;Dogs are Dogs. Thus, Dogs woof&amp;#39; This is invalid but is it consistent?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logic really confuses me, there is too many characterisations and definitions for different jargon. I hate it. Any help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

Personal identity IV](https://youtu.be/OGA0Yo-SoPM)

In the lecture, Kagan considers the cases of amoebas splitting into two identical amoebas, or of Kagan's brain being split and implanted into two separate bodies (a plausible but currently impossible scientific procedure).

These examples lead him to conclude that the body theory of identity, like the personality theory of identity, must stipulate a no branching clause. In other words, the body theory must claim that identity is tied to the body as long as there is no branching into two bodies.

Both body and personality theories have their merits: 

Pro personality:
- if you lose part of your body, such as a hand, you are still the same person
- if your personality were uploaded to a hard drive and then uploaded to another body, ""you"" would be the person in the new body, insofar as you'd probably prefer the old body to be tortured and not the one with your current personality
- body is changing all the time as we age

Pro body:
- personality is changing all the time
- a brain damage incident could abruptly change your personality
- you have no personality while you sleep but you are still you

Kagan himself admits he goes back and forth between the two theories.

With that in mind, is it possible there is a third way? Perhaps personal identity is somehow not empirically observable or definable. As babies, we learn about ""objects"" by putting them in our mouths and touching their boundaries. The idea of an ""object"" is a useful simplification of a constantly changing collection of atoms. Objects seem to have well defined boundaries and are different from other objects. 

However, perhaps under a microscope this qualitative idea of an object doesn't make much sense. And perhaps that's why philosophers struggle to define identity and why the ship of Theseus problem exists. Maybe the empirical reality is that the idea of the human as a single entity works most of the time, but quite expectedly breaks down when we consider the case of brain transplanting or amoeba-like splitting. And it breaks down precisely because our brains have oversimplified the world into objects with clear boundaries, when really the boundaries are blurry and ever-changing.

By analogy, perhaps it's like Newtonian physics to Einsteinian physics: just as Newtonian physics is useful and a good approximation of how the world works, but fails to handle all cases that Einsteinian physics handles, so too does the idea of a world made up of distinct objects help us understand it and serves as a useful approximation, but ultimately fails when presented with cases where the boundaries between objects blur together.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;See for example &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/OGA0Yo-SoPM""&gt;Death- 13.

He also talks about how the idea of a human soul is an error because we can never actually describe where it is in the body or how it gets there. Beyond that, the cycle of rebirth that this single consciousness would imply doesn&amp;#39;t leave any room for an animistic (human/animal/plant/geological spirits) separateness that could continue after death parallel to the rebirth cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am asking for is a convincing, down and dirty argument that is easy to understand that would possibly embrace this pantheistic philosophy to refute the idea of the existence of &amp;quot;ghosts&amp;quot; (poltergeists, spirits that haven&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;crossed over&amp;quot;, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; In the most general way, every isolable element of the universe always appears as a particle that can enter into composition with a whole that transcends it. Being is only found as a whole composed of particles whose relative autonomy is maintained. These two principles dominate the uncertain presence of an ipse being across a distance that never ceases to put everything in question. Emerging in universal play as unforeseeable chance, with extreme dread imperatively becoming the demand for universality, carried away to vertigo by the movement that composes it, the ipse being that presents itself as a universal is only a challenge to the diffuse immensity that escapes its precarious violence, the tragic negation of all that is not its own bewildered phantom's chance . But, as a man, this being falls into the meanders of the knowledge of his fellowmen, which absorbs his substance in order to reduce it to a component of what goes beyond the virulent madness of his autonomy in the total night of the world.

Here's my stab at an explanation:

Bataille advances the metaphysical idea that nothing exists which can’t be further broken down into other components.  Therefore, being is never settled, it is always put in “question”; a thing is never just itself, it is also in constant relation with its own composition and with the other compositions around it.

So maybe from a human perspective, being involves a lot of dread; we dread our unity, the autonomy of our existence, being broken down into component parts through the normal fluctuations of matter in the universe; maybe more simply, we dread death. 

Our dread of death becomes this “imperative demand for universality”.  I interpret this as a need to pin down definitive being somewhere and work our way up to the point where we have a being that won’t just get washed away in a constantly fluctuating universe.  Even if we die, we still existed and there was a universal essence to that existed. 

Human beings express this “imperative demand for universality” through language, which is itself a social composite – a bunch of parts which really have no autonomy of their own.  Our recognition of each other as distinct elements within the composite affirms our being, but maybe Bataille is saying that continuing to impose universal knowledge upon the constant fluctuations of the universe ultimately reveals this “total night of the world”, i.e. knowledge reveals that everything is unstable, only a temporary arrangement, nothing is universal, nothing is certain except for the constant dissolution of certainty.

This is my first post, and I tried to comply with all this sub's rules, but let me know if I missed any. Some context that may be relevant: I am not a philosophy student, and this is one of my first serious ventures into studying philosophy.

So I'm reading *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*. In the first chapter, *Of the different species of philosophy*, Hume distinguishes between two types of philosophy: what he calls the ""easy"" and the ""abstruse"", and while he has some praise for the former, he also argues that the latter is necessary. Now, I guess that he is saying this (at least in part) to prepare the reader for the rest of the book, which will probably be closer to the abstruse kind.

But also, he has very concrete examples in mind, and he mentions some of them, like Cicero (""easy"") and Aristotle (""abstruse""). Even so, I think I may be lacking some context: does Hume have some concrete contemporary examples in mind? Is he referring to the common ways of doing philosophy during his time? 

If anyone can provide some intellectual and historical context that may be valuable for understanding this chapter (and the book in general), that would be great! Or any good references that cover that kind of information.

Also, and as something of bonus questions: what do you think of this twofold distinction he makes? Do you think it is a useful way to classify different writers today? I can think of several current examples of ""easy philosophy"". Also, does he have genuine praise for the ""easy philosophy""? At times he seems quite ironic, and I wonder if that is just his writing style.

I'm posting because I really don't know where else to ask these questions. I checked out the FAQ and couldn't find something similar so either I suck at reading (more likely) or I'm asking a question that no one cares about (doubtful?).

I recently read ""The Conspiracy Against The Human Race"" by Thomas Ligotti. I have to admit, I understood maybe half of what that guy was talking about, but the half I did understand really resonated with me.

I'm not confused after reading it, just depressed. It was exciting to read someone talking about the very things I was thinking and explaining it. It was a source of validation in that I wasn't the only one thinking these thoughts. I understand that this makes me biased but it's still refreshing to read about things I can't talk at parties about without being ignored.

I have to admit, I frequently think about Stephen Fry and other famous atheists clinging to science and the marvel of such and it makes me wonder if in their depression and world view (that I assume mimics this book) this is why they focus exclusively on the marvels of nature. It's a distraction but a great distraction because none of this should be in existence in the first place!

Sorry to be long winded. I guess what I'm asking is that after subscribing to that book, where do I go from here? Who can I talk to? What groups are out there?

I think sometimes of that Mormon guy who studied his religion and came up with 20+ pages of questions for his church leader. This dude just wanted answers, and it was so sad to see him scrambling for answers that didn't exist. It was admirable because this guy was hungering for some sort of conclusion, but it was also depressing because his religion couldn't answer them.

I'm in a similar boat. I don't know where to go from this mind thought. Conciseness is a mistake and I don't want to trick myself into ignoring this fact. Life is suffering.

&lt;p&gt;So why would it be All Kitchens have Shelves. Kitchen is a subset of Shelves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve youtubed, googled formulas that I can follow, like No+No = Invalid conclusions or some+some invalid. Some questions don&amp;#39;t even begin with ALL or Some or No or Not. Then I realized I have to simplify the syllogism.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm trying to think of what kind of logical fallacy that is used in the following claim: ""If prohibition had not been repealed in 1933, we still would not have alcohol to this day.""

I think it's similar to the [Ludic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy), since it tries to use hypothetical model - in this example, a world where the 21st amendment was not passed in 1933 - to determine what would happen in the real world. I think this fallacy is not an entirely precise description of the given claim, since the main flaw in the claim is that it ignores the factor of time (and things changing over time), not just that it applies hypothetical rules to the situation.

Other examples:

* ""If slavery had not been abolished in 1865, there would still be slaves in America today."" (Abolitionist effort and external pressures probably would have led to abolition at some point.)
* ""If polar bears had never evolved, there would be no land predators in the Northern Arctic."" (Other predators may have filled the niche in the ecosystem if polar bears weren't around.)
* ""If I hadn't won the lottery, I never would have bought a car."" (The speaker may have come into another windfall or saved up enough money to buy a car eventually.)

&amp;#x200B;

And would you consider the following examples to be the same kind of fallacy?

* ""Vaccines were banned in France in 1763 because they were dangerous, so we should ban vaccines for being dangerous."" (Ignoring advancements in medicine that have occurred since 1763.)
* ""Early humans were not able to survive without cooking and eating meat, so modern humans should eat meat.""

I was reading this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/dc9tm3/eli5\_what\_does\_i\_think\_therefore\_i\_am\_mean\_and/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/dc9tm3/eli5_what_does_i_think_therefore_i_am_mean_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) which made me think about Descartes reasoning.

&gt;In his work, he goes about destroying the assumptions that most people had in philosophy before him. Many people would say, ""ah well I see the sun, or I feel the grass, so therefore it exists"". Descartes basically said, ""ok, but what if your brain is in a jar, and you are just dreaming all of this?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Philosophy is based on axioms. Axioms are self-evident facets of reason that allow you to construct the rest of philosophy on them. Descartes basically argued that all of the axioms that had previously been used were wrong because they were not self-evident. In the same sense that you don't know you are in a dream when you are dreaming, how do you know that anything around you is as it truly is? So he started his philosophy with doubting **everything.**  
&gt;  
&gt;At first, he couldn't figure out where to go from there. How are you supposed to know anything if you doubt everything? Eventually, he discovers his first axiom: I think therefore I am. In order for him to doubt everything, **he** must exist. He can't assume anything about who or what he really is but he can safely assume that he exists, otherwise, he would not be thinking about the fact that he exists.

Now I’m wondering whether thought is actually a sense (even though you can argue thoughts emerge internally). If thought is accepted as a sense, the same principles for Descartes initial assumption apply to thought. What I mean is; if you can not trust senses such as sight (I see the sun) or feeling (I feel the grass), who says you can trust the sense thought (I think therefore I am)?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;New here so maybe my question may already been covered.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to me that if the Cartesian method is used on “I think therefore I am” I could cast doubt on its validity. As far as I remember, any doubt at all means you have to toss the idea as a truth.

Here goes the list of what I’ve read so far that chronologically are up to Heidegger:

- Pre-Socratics (a book with the study of and the fragments themselves)

- Plato (almost all of his works. What I am do missing are *Theaetetus*, *Timaeus* and *Sophist*)

- Aristotle (*Categories*, *De interpretatione*, some parts of his logic, *De anima*, *Physics*, *Metaphysics*)

- Descartes (*Meditations*)

- Kant (the three critics)

- Hegel (from his own books I’ve read his *Lectures on the philosophy of history*, up to the second part of his *Lectures on Aesthetics*, his *Early theological writings* and a lot from other places, like the SEP, IEP, history of philosophy books and a few articles)

- Husserl (*The Idea of Phenomenology* lectures, with this I’ve got a good grasp of his attempt with the phenomenology as a method and his aim)

- Nietzsche (*Untimely Meditations: David Strauss the confessor and the writer*, *Untimely Meditations: On the use and abuse of history for life* and *The Antichrist*)

- Heidegger (*Building Dwelling Thinking*, *Art and Space*)


I do want to know if this is enough. 

Also, it’s of my interest if you would recommend me to read before *Being and Time* his *The origin of the work of art* and *The basic problems of phenomenology*, or just the latter.

How do you interpret this piece on speculative realism by Dugin? The brief mentions of Meillassoux and Deleuze (not a speculative-realist) say nothing useful in my opinion. The omission of any mention of Meillassoux's critique of correlationism is a real problem, as the recognition that it has at least some merit is one of the key things that that otherwise disparate group agrees on and sets the stage for what they are trying to achieve.

As they say, the globalists are everywhere, and this “hard problem of consciousness” is ubiquitously promoted by such special foundations. This is the grave of philosophizing. Thus, it begins with analytical philosophy and ends philosophy as such.

Can such an action still be described as &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; in self-interest?

End of question.

\----------------------------

*Here are my thought-processes - not needed to address the questions, so you can stop reading here and disregard it - providing background info into what made me ask this:*

At the moment, I'm thoroughly enjoying reading Nietzsche, and I do get how he is critical of Catholicism and other Protestant traditions - yet I find him to confuse it with and thus misrepresent texts of the New Testament. And there *is* a difference between the two.

For example, in ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" we find the idea of eternal recurrence as an expression love for life and this is contrasted to Christianity, which sees this world as inferior and nothing but preparation for the afterlife in Paradise.

The problem with this comparison, as I see it, is that it's false. The New Testament does tell us to take responsibility for *this* world and better both it and ourselves - *and* in the afterlife expect of some reward/judgement based on our actions now. And the NT also (re)presents the idea of a new and re-created earth - right here on this earth and not in some paradise far, far away - where we will reside forever, and where the world will be in perfect balance and we will be good stewards once again. The ""Kingdom of God"" is the blueprint, so to speak, once more applied to the world.

I'm not asking whether or not this responsibility comes from (a) God or elsewhere, as I'm no orthodox Christian and have no issue with Nietzsche not being either. I'm simply pointing to, what I perceive as, a strawman argument.

Again, there have been Christian doctrines and ideas throughout history that has (re)presented the idea that we should suffer our lot in expectance of a better afterlife. I do not challenge that. I do challenge that attacking this tradition is somehow a critique of or alternative thought to the New or Old Testament writings.

And this may be perceived to be hair-splitting. It's not. There's a dramatic and major difference between how one would live his life if he believed he would go to some distant paradise in the afterlife and how one would life if he believed the goal was to aim for the perfect world for eternity - starting now. It's the difference between people taking responsibility for life now and those who say: fuck it all.

I won't make this any longer, it's too long already, but I simply find that Nietzsche didn't really hit the mark with his critique.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question:&lt;/strong&gt; Of the bat, my questions are this: did Nietzsche ever get criticized for misrepresenting Christianity, thus attacking strawmen, in his arguments?

Suppose you have a button in front of you, that upon being pressed, gives you $100,000 and donates to a random orphanage in need $10,000. Obviously, there's no downside to this; unless you viciously hate orphans, you'd press that button and receive your $100,000. And for argument's sake, let's further suppose you intend to keep that $100,000 all for yourself.

Did you just do a ""good deed""? Was it a morally righteous act, as opposed to merely neutral? Obviously your action of pressing the button benefited people in need, but at the same time, the good you did was incidental. You'd have pushed that button regardless, whether some money went to the orphans or not. So it's not as if you acted any different than you acted normally.

For some further consideration, I thought of two other scenarios: one in which nobody tells you that $10,000 is donated to the orphanage, but it happens anyway; thus, you've helped the orphans by pressing the button without being aware of the fact. And another, in which you're lied to: you're under the false belief that pushing the button will donate $10,000 to the orphans, but in reality, it doesn't. It only gives money to you. Does either scenario change whether or not the button push is ""a morally good act"" or not?

---

Now, obviously, I realise there are a million different ways of defining morality, so it's not as if there's a single right answer. I'm mostly just curious how the problem of ""zero effort good deeds"" has been tackled in the past.

You&amp;#39;d have pushed that button regardless, whether some money went to the orphans or not. So it&amp;#39;s not as if you acted any different than you acted normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some further consideration, I thought of two other scenarios: one in which nobody tells you that $10,000 is donated to the orphanage, but it happens anyway; thus, you&amp;#39;ve helped the orphans by pressing the button without being aware of the fact. And another, in which you&amp;#39;re lied to: you&amp;#39;re under the false belief that pushing the button will donate $10,000 to the orphans, but in reality, it doesn&amp;#39;t. It only gives money to you. Does either scenario change whether or not the button push is &amp;quot;a morally good act&amp;quot; or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously, I realise there are a million different ways of defining morality, so it&amp;#39;s not as if there&amp;#39;s a single right answer. I&amp;#39;m mostly just curious how the problem of &amp;quot;zero effort good deeds&amp;quot; has been tackled in the past. To me, it instinctively feels like it shouldn&amp;#39;t really count as a good deed since you aren&amp;#39;t even slightly inconvenienced (and in fact, are greatly rewarded), but a lot of people I&amp;#39;ve talked to seem to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

I've had to settle for readings of subject-specific excerpts of their works paired with internet summaries of their careers. (Reading their whole corpus *would* be preferred, but it's a luxury of time that would add feature creep to an already over-extended writing project.)

My crisis, which is a kind of quasi-epistimological/meaning-making (EDIT: and ""authorial intent"") question, is,

**When do you GET a philosopher?**

And separately but intimately-related,

**Where is the point of irreducibility of any philosopher's propositions?**

&amp;#x200B;

Taking Plato, for example:

It's my understanding that today, people still debate whether Plato's *Republic* was written to be completely literal, completely allegorical, or some mix of the two. Some read it as a pure allegory for the soul; others, for the state. Some see it as depicting both the ideal soul AND state (with an attendant metaphysical relationship between the two). Some interpret these parts over here as literal and those over there as allegory. \[And so on, and so on...\]

You can then multiply this uncertainty against the problems of translation and conceptual context. (The translator of one of my versions of *The Republic* warns away anyone trying to read it besides classical Greek scholars because the wholly alien nature of ancient Greek metaphysics makes its intent inscrutable to its modern, Western conceptions. (For what it's worth, I ignored him.))

&amp;#x200B;

There is clearly a tangible disagreement here, but its argumentation always seems to decay into an infinite appeal to context, with each party arguing that the other is committing some misreading of the base text, for one or more reasons: lack of historicity, lack of authority, poor translation, oversimplification, ignorance of some broader discourse/commentary, or just good old-fashioned bad faith.

&amp;#x200B;

So to restate my initial question in a few different ways/angles:

* At what point do we accept a summary or interpretation (including one's working knowledge) of a given text as doing justice to the substance of its ideas?
* How do you *know* when you've grasped a ""correct"" sense of the philosopher's ideas or concepts and aren't just deluding yourself (or are being deluded, e.g. by some popular figure or authority claiming possession of such a summary)?
* Is this a Nietzschean problem, wherein the totalization of any work ultimately does harm to the original by fabricating a list of ""essential"" characteristics/narratives which in turn erase ""insignificant"" features for wholly arbitrary, selfish reasons? (Is there not a ""pattern"" of ideas in any given work that can be sussed out, a ""voice"" that can, if not reproduce the work word-for-word, at least render its corridors familiar and predictable?)
* EDIT for conciseness: Am I on a fool's errand for even trying to pluck propositions (e.g. concepts, perspectives, positions) out of these works and modify them or test them by applying them to culture/reality/my own subjectivity?
* (Has the very proposition of ""propositions"" become a currency that is irredeemable in a postmodern economy of ideas?)
* Should \[any? some? all?\] philosophical works be read as purely aesthetic and experiential rather than anything bearing significance to reality?
* (Is this seemingly infinite regress simply a bug/feature inherent to continental philosophy? (Or to some philosophers but not others?))

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;li&gt;How do you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; when you&amp;#39;ve grasped a &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; sense of the philosopher&amp;#39;s ideas or concepts and aren&amp;#39;t just deluding yourself (or are being deluded, e.g. by some popular figure or authority claiming possession of such a summary)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this a Nietzschean problem, wherein the totalization of any work ultimately does harm to the original by fabricating a list of &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; characteristics/narratives which in turn erase &amp;quot;insignificant&amp;quot; features for wholly arbitrary, selfish reasons? (Is there not a &amp;quot;pattern&amp;quot; of ideas in any given work that can be sussed out, a &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot; that can, if not reproduce the work word-for-word, at least render its corridors familiar and predictable?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EDIT for conciseness: Am I on a fool&amp;#39;s errand for even trying to pluck propositions (e.g. concepts, perspectives, positions) out of these works and modify them or test them by applying them to culture/reality/my own subjectivity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Has the very proposition of &amp;quot;propositions&amp;quot; become a currency that is irredeemable in a postmodern economy of ideas?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should [any? some? all?] philosophical works be read as purely aesthetic and experiential rather than anything bearing significance to reality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Is this seemingly infinite regress simply a bug/feature inherent to continental philosophy? (Or to some philosophers but not others?))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be appreciated. I feel like I&amp;#39;m taking crazy pills here.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite studying Philosophy in University for my degree, and doing *fine*, I was actually a pretty poor student. I had a firm enough grasp of the basics, and was creative enough to form arguments, but due to personal reasons, had very little focus and did very little actual Philosophical reading.

Now that my degree is over and I find myself with more free time, I want to get back into studying it.

I don't know if I'm confident enough reading the old texts yet, especially not with breaking them down, so I'm asking what else I can do.

1. Existence Exists
2. The Law of Identity
3. Consciousness

It seems to me that both The Law of Identity and Consciousness have a dependency on Existence Existing in order to be. 

The description of ""The Law of Identity"" mentions, ""Identity is the [concept](http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Epistemology_Concepts.html) that refers to this aspect of existence; the aspect of existing as something in particular, with specific characteristics. An entity without an identity cannot exist because it would be [nothing](http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Metaphysics_Nothing.html).

With ""Consciousness"" it mentions ""Identity is the [concept](http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Epistemology_Concepts.html) that refers to this aspect of existence; the aspect of existing as something in particular, with specific characteristics.

How I'm understanding this is that this is what can exist in existence (essentially the definition of identities) which relies on Existence Existing in order to work.

I really have more than one question on this content. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to have more than one question but here goes:

1. Does the ""The Law of Identity"" and ""Consciousness"" actually stand on their own two feet as axioms without being dependent on Existence Existing or are the dependent like how I'm seeing it? If they are not dependent can you help me understand why.
2. Can axioms be dependent on each other or does that contradict their definition?

For example Wouldn't John Locke's Labor theory of property be more supportive of a collective ownership of the means of production and a rejection of absentee ownership found so commonly under capitalism?  Did Rousseau not feel that private property has it's origins in the deception of others given his quote

&gt; The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said 'This is  mine', and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the  true founder of civil society.

For example Wouldn&amp;#39;t John Locke&amp;#39;s Labor theory of property be more supportive of a collective ownership of the means of production and a rejection of absentee ownership found so commonly under capitalism?  Did Rousseau not feel that private property has it&amp;#39;s origins in the deception of others given his quote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said &amp;#39;This is  mine&amp;#39;, and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the  true founder of civil society.  &lt;/p&gt;

In this case, it doesn't just happen to be the case that nothing travels faster than light, but nothing **necessarily** can ever travel faster than the speed of light, even in principle, because there is a law of nature which stops that ever being the case. The Regularity account, on the other hand, states that the regularities we see are just that - regularities. It isn't necessarily the case that nothing can go faster than the speed of light or that there is an entity in our ontology making that the case, but instead that's just the regularity we observe.

Could these two ways of thinking be applied to the Laws of Logic, by which I mean Identity, Non-contradiction and Excluded-middle? Most people's way of thinking seems to automatically be in the Necessitarian camp, i.e. there really do exist these things called the 'Laws of Logic' which are mind independent and govern reason and reality itself. In this account, the reason why, for any A, ""A=A"" is true is because the Law of Identity forces it to hold **necessarily,** and it could not be otherwise. Likewise, any statement ""A∧¬A"" is false because the Law of Non-contradiction acts on the statement, forcing it to be false by necessity. A Regularity account of this, on the other hand, could theoretically state that these are just regularities. For example, the Identity relation doesn't have to hold by necessity, but it just so happens that for all statements we observe it does happen to be true. Likewise, it isn't the case that all contradictions must be false necessarily and it could not be the case otherwise, but it is simply a regularity that we observe that all contradictions happen to be false. 

Are there any philosophers who have written anything related to this? Do you think that the comparison holds, or do you think Laws of Nature and Laws of Logic are like apples and oranges, i.e. not comparable?

I hope all of you are doing well.

First off, I hope this is an appropriate question to ask. Though it's more on the theological side, I feel like it is still an important philosophical question.

So! A little background...

I've been a Christian all my life. Only recently have I gotten to asking questions. Some I find answers to; others are just kind of left on an edge without a graspable answer. This is probably just due to my not looking far enough. Over the past few weeks, I have been plagued with a train of thought that has ultimately culminated in a dialogue with myself in a journal that posed the ultimatum:

""The sole purpose of life is to get to heaven. The sole goal is to bring others to God. All other pleasures, work, art, and play is meaningless, vapid, and an illusion. One should set his or her eyes solely on God in order to obtain true peace.""

Which, I think, is kind of depressing. The whole purpose of 80+ years of life is just to remain a Christian and bring more people to Christendom? No room for individuality? The Bible does talk of working your hardest and putting your all into it, but how does any thing besides getting to heaven matter when this life is just a spec compared to the eternity of the next life? If everything in this life is eventually wiped away, why does any of it matter?

I don't want to support this belief, but I find it reasonable. I come to you all in search of new ideas to get out of this line of thinking. Any thing you have to say can help.

For facts about the word, philosophers have developed the scientific method, a set of tools to find (albeit limited) truths regarding factual truths. Applying this method has been quite fruitful. It seems to me that the scientific process is already ""outside"" philosophy: it does not apply philosophical methods such as logical argumentation, but relies on hypotheses and testing.

However, I have not yet heard about a similar project in ethics.

As far as I understand, in ethics there is applied ethics, taking a set of ethical principles and using them to decide problems in the real world. Compared to science, this seems like using a model or a formula to make predictions.

There is also normative ethics, which [according to the IEP](https://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/) ""takes on a more practical task, which is to arrive at moral standards that regulate right and wrong conduct"". However, as far as I understand, it does this by applying standard philosophical methods such as argumentation and and logical deduction.

Meta-ethics also seems to miss what I want, since it seems to be occupied with discerning the exact meaning of ethical sentences, though I could be wrong.

Is there something that could be described as ""epistemology of moral facts"" that tries to find principles and methods which can be used to make moral progress, starting only from moral intuitions?

Or is the answer simply ""Use standard philosophical methodoloy""?

I'd really like to get some pointers on these questions.

This is my first day as a Reddit member, and this is my first post.

My question concerns a couple of defences to the theist problem of evil (if there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent god, why do bad things happen?).

I’m doing Caspar Hare’s MOOC on EDX (a great course by the way at least for beginners like me), and the following defences for God (along others) were mentioned:

*  Bad things are required to make good things good, without any bad there wouldn’t really be any good and the world would be a boring place, which is not a good thing.
* Forcing people to be good would violate their free will, which again would not be a good world to live in.

The picture that I got from the lecture was that both of these arguments, especially the latter one, have been appealing to many people. Yet I’m so unconvinced by them that I suspect there is some piece missing in my own understanding of the arguments. Could you help me in pointing out what might that be?

My problem is that the arguments seem to appeal to human psyche, as in the brain would be fixed in some way.

For example the claim that “the world would be a boring place if everyone were good” seems intuitively true for sure, but being bored is a function of the brain, which supposedly was designed by an all powerful, all good, all knowing creator. When designing the brain, if you're omnipotent, why add boringness?

I feel the same way about the argument to free will. Surely I can see how a world, where people are in some sense free, and capable of good and evil, is a much more beautiful, a much better world than a world where everyone would, say, just lay still like zombies on eternal ecstasy while God keeps their dopamine levels to the roof. But again my depiction of what a good and beautiful world is like is a function of my brain. It's just the way we humans are wired by evolution and by culture. So why wire us that way?

In a nutshell: why would an all good, all powerful, all knowing god design the human brain in such a way that it demands a world with suffering in it to be happy?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y’all!

The 3 demands that I am referring to are described in Section 8 of the Introduction entitled Division of the Subject and begin on page 70 of the Knox translation.

The first reads as follows: ''The first point here is the demand that the content which is to come into artistic representation should be in itself qualified for such representation.'' Now, as far as I can tell, this is demanding that the content of a work must be something that pushes us further to the spirit; it must push us to see the Idea, in the same way that the content of philosophy and religion do.

The second reads: ''The second demand, derived from the first, requires of the content of art that it be not anything abstract in itself, but concrete, thought not concrete in the sense in which the sensuous is concrete when it is contrasted with everything spiritual and intellectual and these are taken to be simple and abstract'' So, concrete in terms of the form means that its material grounds us in the here and now, right? It's something we can engage with/perceive but the actual material nature reminds us of what our own finite nature. So, the concrete in terms of the content then is that it is something human, right? The actual form of the content \[so Greek sculptures of beautiful human bodies depicting Greek Gods\] must be natural, but must simultaneously, to keep in mind the first demand, be something that can call beyond itself.

The third reads: ''Now, thirdly, if a sensuous form and shape is to correspond with a genuine and therefore concrete content, it must likewise be something individual, in itself completely concrete and single. The fact that the concrete accrues to both sides of art, i.e. to both content and its presentation, is precisely the point in which both can coincide and correspond with one another; just as for instance, the nature shape of the human body is such a sensuously concrete thing, capable of displaying spirit, which is concrete in itself, and of showing itself in conformity with it.'' This is the demand that I find most confusing and have a very weak interpretation of. From what I can tell, its saying that form and content have to be complimentary, otherwise we will not look beyond the immediate reality of the piece of fine art to see the potentialities that lay before us. And this must be a conscious choice on the side of the artist.

Any help anyone can give in understanding these demands would be very much appreciated, be it a confirmation of my own interpretations, or a rendering of their own interpretation.

I'm a pre-Pharmacy student and I'm considering minoring in Philosophy for various reasons:

1. In high school, I took an Introduction to Philosphy course and a course on Ethics and on Sciences and Philosophy, and I aced all 3 of them and found Phillsophy to be a very interesting subject. It motivated me to go beyond the given curriculum.

2. A friend gifted me a book called Introduction to Hegel, and I devoured it with great interest, and I know I want more. I don't have any solid argument against his points, I find myself agreeing with most of what he says but I reckon that with more studying of Philosophy, I could possibly hone my critical thinking skills.

3. I've read on how a philosophy minor is interesting in building critical thinking skills but also a sound understanding on ethics, what it is to be human, the mind and more relatively universal subjects.

Now I have solid time management skills: I'm a diploma level pianist, a Model United Nations trainer and I'm managing my Pre-Pharm courses really well so far (A level) but my biggest concern is:

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read on how a philosophy minor is interesting in building critical thinking skills but also a sound understanding on ethics, what it is to be human, the mind and more relatively universal subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have solid time management skills: I&amp;#39;m a diploma level pianist, a Model United Nations trainer and I&amp;#39;m managing my Pre-Pharm courses really well so far (A level) but my biggest concern is:
Is minoring in Philosophy interesting to me as a Pharmacy student? Are the two fields compatible in any way? I know Philosophy and Business, Computer Sciences or other fields can be more immediately compatible but what about Pharmacy?&lt;/p&gt;

i hope this is the right subreddit, but i'm experiencing severe distress at the moment and would like to hear your opinions/views...

i always had quite the interest in philosophy and recently started reading more about it after i had a discussion with a friend. He introduced me to the idea (experience in his words) of non-duality, and made pretty convincing links to modern science which in a way acknowledges this. 
I was quite interested at first and started reading about it, stuff like advaita vedanta, open individualism, ego-death, universal consciousness and 'the veil of maya'.

I always saw myself as a rather rational, science-based person. The thought of death just beeing the end of everything without any form of afterlife or reincarnation didn't scare me, i actually found it comforting in a way. Eternity, if you think about it, (IMO) is a terrible thing to experience.

especially on r/awakened there a lot of people who are utterly convinced that they figured out a kind of 'truth' about the nature of reality/being/consciousness. They argue that nonduality is 'true' because it is something you experience by deducting everything until all you have left is 'pure awareness' - which is (if i understood it right) everything there is. So basically everything is an illusion, there is no ego, no seperated human consciousness, no boundaries between an 'objective', physical universe and the subjective experience filtered through the consciousness/brain of every person. 

This idea deeply scares me, and i really hope that it is not true. I may have made the biggest mistake in my life by reading about this, because now i have that feeling in the back of my head that everything is illusionary/fake/attachment/maya whatever you call it. Since i have learned about it, i struggle with finding sense in almost everything. what's the point of relationships if you always are basically talking with 'yourself'? What is the point in music or art if it is all illusionary and 'not the real thing'? What is the point of working towards self-improvement or a career if that very 'self' does not exist? Why even bother living at all if it's all some kind of sick play which mostly means suffering?
(isn't that for example the main goal of Buddhists, to escape dukkha/life by reaching a state of nonexistence?)

I may be wrong about my interpretation of these things - i purposely stopped reading about it in an attempt to fall further down the philosophical rabbit-hole... but i get the feeling i discovered something i am not ready for yet. I'm quite young, i was in the middle of building the foundations of my life and now im in a constant state of anxiety. Existing and being conscious at all freaks my out, i look at my friends in a different way i did before... like everything i see is just myself, and it's terrifying. I wish i could erase the memory of what i've read about, because before that i was kind of able to enjoy life.. you should know that i suffer from depression and some kind of anxiety (coupled with derealisation/depersonalisation) for some time, i'm currently seeing a therapist but im almost convinced that he can't help with these issues. i get a 'you can't run away from the truth' feeling. I've read on r/awakened that DR/DP are just 'symptoms' of a spiritual awakening, and im scared that i started a process i can't reverse. Like C.G. Jung said, ""beware of unearned knowledge"".

all this stuff really worsens my symptoms, especially as it really seems like there is a strong correlation between scientific approaches and 'eastern' philosophy. 
There is a woman called Suzanne Segal, who in the eyes of spiritual folks reached some form of 'enlightenment', but most of the time it was utter terror for her. I don't want to live a life like that, i'd rather be dead. 
I try to keep a sceptic approach, but i think you can't 'disprove' nonduality because it probably is true :/

So my question is, did i made some major misunderstandings about nonduality?
How does it make your life better/enjoy it more?
Isn't it basically some wicked form or Solipsism? I mean, if we all are that one universal awareness, that awareness is eventually 'alone'? If it is true like most people say, why don't they teach about it in schools?

So correct me if I'm wrong, but basically Kant's criticism to cosmological arguments lie in the fact that causation is a feature of the phenomenal world not of the noumenal word and thus we can't extend the principle of causation outside of the experienced world (so we can't apply it to the creation of the universe by saying that the universe needs to have cause by virtue of it being contingent).

And I've been reading some of the work of Richard Swinburne and Edward Feser and watching some of their lectures, and basically Swinburne answer Kant by objecting his conception of causation (which is that causation is matter of pattern of phenomena), he doesn't view the causation of event B by event A as simply meaning that there is a pattern where event A is followed by event B but rather that the substance ""event A"" has the power or the property to cause ""event B"" (he does that by showing that basic actions such as a human moving his hand can't be understood by Kant's understanding of causation), so causation doesn't have to exemplify regularity, and thus there can be a singular causation ie. God creating the universe.

While Feser answers Kant by saying that "" It is true that we learn the principle of causality from our experience of the world, but it doesn’t follow that we cannot apply it beyond the world of experience. For the reason we conclude that the things of our experience require causes is not because we experience them, but rather because they are merely potential until made actual. And the principle that no potential can actualize itself is completely general. Once we learn it we can apply it beyond the things we have actually experienced, and there is no reason to doubt that we can apply it as well beyond what we could experience.""(extract from Feser's book 5 proofs of the existence of God), and Feser's also adopting an Aristotelian model of causation similar to Swinburnes'.

One about gender and communication, an ethics course and another about sociological well being (this last one shouldn't count as much but it's been taking a very philosophical approach about it). And I've been contrasting it to my knowledge and other courses in Engineering and I have to say, apart from the use of logic, mostly, the way of studying things and understanding things is truly too different between the two. And it's struck me a lot because I think that there is a lot of knowledge that's valuable, even if just to consider it, from both sides.

The Gender class has also made me think about this after making some heavy claims that either directly or partially contradict various biological notions.

And then would the many worlds theory then be applicable within each simulated reality?

As I’m examining the “Inner and Outer Morality” and the tripartite of the soul section, I’m struggling to understand what Socrates’s view of human nature is. 

Does he ever specifically imply if it’s inherently moral/immoral? Rational? Solely contingent upon upbringing? 

He does mention that “you create morality by making the components of mind control be controlled as nature intended” (444 d). So this made me think he he sees humans as inherently rational, as rationality ruling over the other 2 parts creates a controlled soul.

I’m also confused regarding the connection to the ideal community. I understand that he connects the tripartite and the ideal community as follows:

1. Rational part of mind = guardians
2. Spiritual part of mind = auxiliaries 
3. Irrational part of mind = working class

However, does this mean that the auxiliaries’ minds are taken over by the spirit part, the working class minds are taken over by the irrational part, etc., but when they stick to their respective class and work as intended, the soul of the community balances out and, therefore, the individual souls?

OR

Is he simply just doing that for to draw comparison and clarification and the rational part of the mind of every individual, regardless of class, is actually ruling over his/her mind?

Dworkin is arguing that external moral skeptics (people that deny that morality is ""real"") are inherently wrong. The author, on the other hand, understands that morality is real, and it is objective (there is objective moral truth).

To prove his point (discarding external skeptics) he presents the following conversation between four people (Dworkin's words):

* *Person a: Abortion is morally wicked: we always in all circumstances have a categorical reason—a reason that does not depend on what anyone wants or thinks—to prevent and condemn it.*
* *Person b: On the contrary. In some circumstances abortion is morally required. Single teenage mothers with no resources have a categorical reason to abort.*
* *Person c: You are both wrong. Abortion is never either morally required or morally forbidden. No one has a categorical reason either way. It is always permissible and never mandatory, like cutting your fingernails.*
* *Person d: You are all three wrong. Abortion is never either morally forbidden or morally required or morally permissible. Any proposition that assumes the existence of something that does not exist is false. Or (as I sometimes think) neither true nor false. A, B, and C are all assuming that moral duties exist. But no such thing exists, so none of them is making a true statement.*

Dworkin says that both ""a"", ""b"" and ""c"" make moral claims, no issue here. He also says that, while ""d"" attempts to present a morally neutral stance, he is actually presenting a moral statement that is actually the same as ""c"". 

His words: *""D's claim that no duties exist means that no one ever has a reason of that kind. So perforce he expresses a moral position; he agrees with C and cannot say, without contradictionn, that what C says is false (or neither true nor false). \[...\]If he thinks that categorical reasons are impossible, then once again he thinks that no one has a categorical reason for anything. He still takes a moral stand. \[...\] He assesses the strength of the three moral opinions and finds none of them stronger than either of the others. That is a form of skepticism, but it is internal skepticism.""*

Hence - according to the author - external skepticism makes no sense. Thus, morality exists. 

Wait. What!?

That seems like a hasty conclusion...

Imagine the ""Spaghetti Monster"" religion or whatever. Let's say that in the Spaghetti bible unbelievers go to the 6th level of spaghetti hell. Three individuals are having a conversation on the size of the ""Spaghetti Monster."" The first one says he is fifty meters wide; the second says that he is ten meters wide. The third says that the creature does not exist. Both the first and the second debaters immediately accuse him of being an unbeliever and point out that his stance had been predicted in Spaghetti scripture and, thus, not only the ""Spaghetti Monster"" exists but his (the third guy's) opinion is actually proof that it exists. Why stop at Spaghetti Monsters? Anything goes. 

I cannot believe that I understood this correctly. I'm a simple grad student in Law. Dworkin's argument is probably more complicated than what I understood. However, I can't seem to grasp where I got it wrong.

&lt;p&gt;ie actually being in control of your actions. free control without being forced to do things by determinism and indeterminism. being able to decide to do otherwise without it being forced upon you by random forces. unlike siri (iphone assistant) who can only do things according to determinism and indeterminism. same goes for humans and all other animals on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

Last week in one of my philosophy classes the professor was explaining to us the different ways in which science is divided into, and how the methods used by each branch of science corresponds specifically to the subject they study, i.e. the methodology used to prove hypotheses in physics would be different to that used in psychology. 

So after explaining this to us he goes on to criticize many contemporary thinkers because they forget this basic epistemological principle, putting forth the example of Richard Dawkins trying to explain away the existence of God through the methods used in biology or with biological arguments. He later went on to say that as God is a being beyond material existence then the only branch of science which could correctly tackle that issue epistemologically speaking would be Metaphysics.

Now, I found the general idea quite interesting since I'm quite ignorant of epistemology and had never even thought of the idea of other sciences stepping in on eachother and trying to explain facts from their own perspective as an issue much less a scientific error. 

However, I'm skeptical. As I said I'm very ignorant on the subject and I'm not aware if what my professor said is a basic rule of science or if it's a point of view which favors and tends to the ultimate conclusion that God (or anything which is immaterial for that matter, the soul, angels, etc.) cannot and will not ever be proven false by the empirical sciences.

Lately, I've been specifically working through the fifth chapter where he presents what felt to me to be an interesting skeptical critique of meaning. It reminded me somewhat of what I'd learnt about skeptical interpretations of Wittgenstein, for example.

So, I'm really curious about 1. whether and to what extent there are parallels to Dignaga's arguments in Western philosophy and 2. how viable these arguments are today, do they construe a reasonable challenge to modern notions of language-meaning or are their scope confined only to earlier and more rudimentary accounts of language?

To give the arguments as briefly as I can: Dignaga rejects the idea that the meaning of a word is just its extension because it's impossible to uniquely determine the (potentially infinite) extension of a term based on just a finite set of particular instances, making it impossible to learn the meaning of words by direct association. He also points out the if the meaning of a word was explained only in terms of its intension, understood as some ontologically real property or universal, co-reference between non-synonymous terms would be inexplicable. He then considers the idea that you can combine the two approaches and say that a word refers to an individual by virtue of it's being an instantiation of the property or universal that is meant by the word's intension. He rejects this because it would make inexplicable the hierarchical nature of concepts and the purely semantic relationships between words. According to Dignaga, per this proposal, in the phrase ""the color red"" the word ""color"" and the word ""red"" would co-refer to the same entity merely because the properties ""being a color"" and ""being red"" co-occur in the same particular trope that is the reference of that expression. This is apparently a problem because, then, the fact that all instances of red are also instances of color would be a merely empirical fact about the respective properties meant by ""red"" and ""color"". Take, by contrast, the term ""hot fire"". Here, the phrase refers to an entity that both has heat and is fire, ie simultaneously co-instantiates the properties ""having heat"" and ""being fire"". It just so happens that all instances of ""being fire"" are instances of ""having heat"". This, however, is just an empirical fact. It is not a priori impossible for there to be cold fire. However, the same thing is not true about ""color"" and ""red"". The phrase ""the odor red"" is, in this respect, fundamentally different from the phrase ""cold fire"" insofar as it is impossible for red to be an odor by virtue of its meaning itself and not merely by virtue of the patterns of co-instantiations that happen to occur between the properties meant by the respective terms. That is to say, you do not learn this fact by an act of induction.

As a caveat, I should mention that I took some liberties in ""localizing"" the arguments, rendering sanskrit philosophical terminology such as ""bhinna"", ""samanya"", and ""samanadhikaranyam"" as ""extension"", ""intension"", and ""co-reference"", etc. So, if you have a concern specifically about the terminology, I can try to clarify what I understood Dignaga to mean by such terms.

To recap my questions, anyhow: How does this argument fare, overall? Is it viable? And are there any parallels in Western philosophy?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently been working through the Pramana-samuccaya (tr. “Compendium of Epistemology”) by Dignaga, a south indian philosopher from roughly the 6th ce who wrote on a variety of topics in epistemology and the philosophy of language. Lately, I&amp;#39;ve been specifically working through the fifth chapter where he presents what felt to me to be an interesting skeptical critique of meaning. It reminded me somewhat of what I&amp;#39;d learnt about skeptical interpretations of Wittgenstein, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;""Becoming-"" is a process of change, flight, or movement within an assemblage. Rather than conceive of the pieces of an assemblage as an organic whole, within which the specific elements are held in place by the organization of a unity, the process of ""becoming-"" serves to account for relationships between the ""discrete"" elements of the assemblage.

The process is one of deterritorialization in which the properties of the constituent element disappear and are replaced by the new properties of the assemblage—""becomings-molecular of all kinds, becomings-particles"" (D&amp;G 272).

Neither does it have to do with an objective analogy between assemblages. The question is whether Little Hans can endow his own elements with the relations of movement and rest, the affects, that would make it become horse, forms and subjects aside. Is there an as yet unknown assemblage that would be neither Hans's nor the horse's, but that of the becoming-horse of Hans? An assemblage, for example in which the horse would bare its teeth and Hans might show something else, his feet, his legs, his peepee-maker, whatever? (D&amp;G 257-58)

Can you treat people equally and oppress them? Some think this is inherently contradictory (equality being opposed to oppression), others argue it is potentially possible (think tall poppy syndrome)

Rather, we evolved to perceive the world in ways which are beneficial for our survival. Sometimes that aligns with objective reality, other times it doesn’t.

In other words, sometimes us humans delude ourselves because it’s beneficial for our survival.

3. An updated set of guidelines for user flairs.

4. An explanation of the Open Discussion Threads.


#The Purpose of /r/askphilosophy

/r/askphilosophy aims to provide serious, well-researched answers to philosophical questions. We envision this subreddit as the philosophical counterpart to /r/AskHistorians, which is well-known for its high quality answers to historical questions.

/r/askphilosophy is thus a place to ask and answer philosophical questions. **/r/askphilosophy is not a debate or discussion subreddit.**

###Questions on /r/askphilosophy should be:

* Distinctly philosophical (i.e. not merely tangentially related to philosophy)

* Specific enough to be reasonably be answered (i.e. not extremely broad to the point of unanswerability)

* Posed in good faith (i.e. not posed for an agenda)

* Questions about philosophy, e.g. arguments in philosophy, philosophers' positions, the state of the field (not questions about commenters' opinions)

###Answers on /r/askphilosophy should be:

* Substantive and well-researched (i.e. not one-liners or otherwise uninformative)

* Accurately portray the state of research and literature (i.e. not inaccurate or false)

* Come only from those with relevant knowledge of the question (i.e. not from commenters who don't understand the state of the research on the question)

###Comments other than answers on /r/askphilosophy should be one of the following:

* Follow-up questions related to the OP's question

* Follow-up questions to a particular answer

* Discussion of the accuracy of a particular answer

* Thanks, gratitude, etc. for a particular answer.

All other comments are off-topic and will be removed.

#Rules

###Posting Rules

1. All questions must be about philosophy. Questions which are only tangentially related to philosophy or are properly located in another discipline will be removed. Questions which are about therapy, psychology and self-help, even when due to philosophical issues, are not appropriate and will be removed.

2. All submissions must be actual questions (as opposed to essays, rants, personal musings, idle or rhetorical questions, etc.). ""Test My Theory"" or ""Change My View""-esque questions, paper editing, etc. are not allowed.

3. Post titles must be descriptive. Titles should indicate what the question is about. Posts with titles like ""Homework help"" which do not indicate what the actual question is will be removed.

4. Questions must be reasonably specific. Questions which are too broad to the point of unanswerability will be removed.

5. Questions must not be about commenters' personal opinions, thoughts or favorites. /r/askphilosophy is not a discussion subreddit, and is not intended to be a board for everyone to share their thoughts on philosophical questions.

6. One post per day. Please limit yourself to one question per day.

7. Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit /r/suicidewatch. See also a discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth). Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden.

###Commenting Rules

1. All top level comments should be answers to the submitted question, or follow-up questions related to the OP. All comments must be on topic. If a follow-up question is deemed to be too unrelated from the OP, it may be removed.

2. All answers must be informed and aimed at helping the OP and other readers reach an understanding of the issues at hand. Answers must portray an accurate picture of the issue and the philosophical literature. Answers should be reasonably substantive. 

3. Be respectful. Comments which are rude, snarky, etc. may be removed, particularly if they consist of personal attacks. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Racism, bigotry and use of slurs are absolutely not permitted.

4. Stay on topic. Comments which blatantly do not contribute to the discussion may be removed.

5. Frequent commenters should become panelists and request flair. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/flair) for more information on becoming a panelist.

#Flair Guidelines

###The Purpose of Flair

After some discussion and a few challenging flair request cases, we are significantly revising the way in which we label panelists in the hopes of making flair more clearly communicate certain sorts of panelist expertise.

But first, a reminder of the purpose of flairs on /r/askphilosophy. Unlike in some subreddits, the purpose of flairs on /r/askphilosophy are not to designate commenters' areas of interest. The purpose of flair is to indicate commenters' relevant expertise in philosophical areas and research. As philosophical issues are often complicated and have potentially thousands of years of research to sift through, knowing when someone is an expert in a given area can be important in helping understand and weigh the given evidence.

###Who Qualifies for Flair

Given this understanding, **flair will only be given to those with research expertise in some area of philosophy**. Flair is not simply for those interested in a given area or topic, but rather for those who have studied it intensively and are qualified and prepared to provide well-researched and developed answers to questions.

###Flair Areas

Further, flair will be given only in particular areas or research topics in philosophy. Typical areas include things like ""philosophy of mind"", ""logic"", ""continental philosophy"". Flair will not be granted for specific research subjects, e.g. ""Kant on logic"", ""metaphysical grounding"", ""epistemic modals"". Flair of specific philosophers will only be granted if that philosopher is clearly and uncontroversially a monumentally important philosopher, e.g. Confucius, Kant, Nietzsche.

Flair will be given in a maximum of three areas.

###The Varieties of Flair

Previously, there was some confusion about the scope and difference between graduate and professional flair, and some reasoned disagreement about what sorts of academics might appropriately be understood to be experts about certain philosophical topics. As such, we have fully redesigned our flair guidelines and increased the types of flair to better respond to the various ways in which people develop their expertise and the various stages of that development which they find themselves in. The names of some of the categories remain the same, but their scope is slightly different to accommodate two new panelist areas.

* **Autodidact** - The panelist has little or no formal education in philosophy, but is an enthusiastic self-educator and intense reader in a field.

* **Undergraduate** - The panelist is enrolled in or has completed formal undergraduate coursework in Philosophy. In the US system, for instance, this would be indicated by a major (BA) or minor.

* **Graduate** - The panelist is enrolled in a graduate program or has completed an MA in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their coursework might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a degree in Philosophy. For example, a student with an MA in Literature whose coursework and thesis were focused on Derrida's deconstruction might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to an MA in Philosophy.

* **PhD** - The panelist has completed a PhD program in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their degree might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in Philosophy. For example, a student with a PhD in Art History whose coursework and dissertation focused on aesthetics and critical theory might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in philosophy.

* **Professional** - The panelist derives their full-time employment through philosophical work outside of academia. Such panelists might include Bioethicists working in hospitals, Lawyers who work on the Philosophy of Law, Ontologists, etc.

* **Related Field** - The panelist has expertise in some sub-field of philosophy but their work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy. For example, a PhD in Physics whose research touches on issues relating to the entity/structural realism debate clearly has expertise relevant to philosophical issues but is reasonably understood to be working primarily in another field.

These new divisions aim primarily at two things: (1) more clearly communicating the kind of expertise held by panelists and (2) streamlining a few troublesome aspects of the flair application process.

###Updating Your Flair

Since some of these changes involve carving up old flair categories, some re-categorizations of panelists may be required. In order to make this as simple as possible, the flair conversion will go as follows for each respective, current flair category:

* Current Autodidact flair holders (grey) remain as they are.

* Current Undergraduate flair holders (red) remain as they are.

* Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who do not hold PhDs in Philosophy or hold an equivalent PhD remain as they are.

* Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work inside academia remain as they are. This flair category will be renamed ""PhD.""

The following types of panelists should message moderators for a change in flair color:

* Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who have completed a PhD in Philosophy or hold a PhD which is equivalent to a PhD in philosophy (as described above) should ask for a ""PhD"" flair.

* Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who are active students or have completed just an MA in a related field but whose work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy should ask for a ""Related Field"" (green) flair.

* Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work in in a related field but whose work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy should ask for a ""Related Field"" (green) flair.

* Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work outside of academia should ask for a new ""Pro"" (blue) flair.

As always, panelists who could qualify for more than one type of flair are welcome to choose how to represent themselves. In making this choice, panelists should at least try to represent their expertise in a way that will match how they tend to answer questions in the sub.

If you are not sure whether or not you should be re-classified, then message the moderators and we will help sort out your flair.

###Requesting Flair

Frequent commenters should become panelists and request flair, pursuant to the above flair guidelines. To request flair, please send a message to the moderators via modmail with the subject 'Flair Request for /r/askphilosophy', detailing which flair you are requesting and why. All flair requests should contain:

* The flair type you are requesting (e.g. undergraduate, PhD, related field).

* The areas of flair you are requesting, up to 3 (e.g. Kant, continental philosophy, logic).

* A brief explanation of your background in philosophy, including what qualifies you for the flair you requested.

/r/askphilosophy **does not require users to provide proof of their identifies for flair requests, nor to reveal their identities. There is thus an expectation that all frequent commenters will become panelists and request flair.**

#Open Discussion Threads

Each week /r/askphilosophy has an ""Open Discussion Thread"" (ODT), which is posted once a week and stickied to the top of the subreddit. These threads are a place for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but wouldn't necessarily meet our posting rules. For example, these threads are great places for:

* Personal opinion questions, e.g. ""who is your favourite philosopher?""

* ""Test My Theory"" discussions and argument/paper editing

* ""Change My View"" style discussions

* Discussion not necessarily related to any particular question, e.g. about what you're currently reading

* Questions about academic philosophy

* Questions about therapy, psychology or self-help, e.g. ""How do I deal with determinism?""

We hope that the ODTs provide a venue for the /r/askphilosophy community to engage in the types of discussion which do not formally meet our rules, but with and within the excellent community of /r/askphilosophy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we are going live with a new set of rules and guidelines which we hope will clarify our vision for &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; and help improve this community going forward. This post contains four major parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An explanation of our goals for &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated rule-set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated set of guidelines for user flairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An explanation of the Open Discussion Threads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Purpose of &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; aims to provide serious, well-researched answers to philosophical questions. We envision this subreddit as the philosophical counterpart to &lt;a href=""/r/AskHistorians""&gt;/r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt;, which is well-known for its high quality answers to historical questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; is thus a place to ask and answer philosophical questions. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; is not a debate or discussion subreddit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Questions on &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; should be:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinctly philosophical (i.e. not merely tangentially related to philosophy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific enough to be reasonably be answered (i.e. not extremely broad to the point of unanswerability)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posed in good faith (i.e. not posed for an agenda)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about philosophy, e.g. arguments in philosophy, philosophers&amp;#39; positions, the state of the field (not questions about commenters&amp;#39; opinions)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Answers on &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; should be:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substantive and well-researched (i.e. not one-liners or otherwise uninformative)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurately portray the state of research and literature (i.e. not inaccurate or false)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come only from those with relevant knowledge of the question (i.e. not from commenters who don&amp;#39;t understand the state of the research on the question)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Comments other than answers on &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; should be one of the following:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up questions related to the OP&amp;#39;s question&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up questions to a particular answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion of the accuracy of a particular answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, gratitude, etc. for a particular answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other comments are off-topic and will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Rules&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Posting Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All questions must be about philosophy. Questions which are only tangentially related to philosophy or are properly located in another discipline will be removed. Questions which are about therapy, psychology and self-help, even when due to philosophical issues, are not appropriate and will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All submissions must be actual questions (as opposed to essays, rants, personal musings, idle or rhetorical questions, etc.). &amp;quot;Test My Theory&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Change My View&amp;quot;-esque questions, paper editing, etc. are not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post titles must be descriptive. Titles should indicate what the question is about. Posts with titles like &amp;quot;Homework help&amp;quot; which do not indicate what the actual question is will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions must be reasonably specific. Questions which are too broad to the point of unanswerability will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions must not be about commenters&amp;#39; personal opinions, thoughts or favorites. &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; is not a discussion subreddit, and is not intended to be a board for everyone to share their thoughts on philosophical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One post per day. Please limit yourself to one question per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit &lt;a href=""/r/suicidewatch""&gt;/r/suicidewatch&lt;/a&gt;. See also a discussion of philosophy and mental health issues &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Commenting Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All top level comments should be answers to the submitted question, or follow-up questions related to the OP. All comments must be on topic. If a follow-up question is deemed to be too unrelated from the OP, it may be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers must be informed and aimed at helping the OP and other readers reach an understanding of the issues at hand. Answers must portray an accurate picture of the issue and the philosophical literature. Answers should be reasonably substantive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be respectful. Comments which are rude, snarky, etc. may be removed, particularly if they consist of personal attacks. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Racism, bigotry and use of slurs are absolutely not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay on topic. Comments which blatantly do not contribute to the discussion may be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent commenters should become panelists and request flair. See &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/flair""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information on becoming a panelist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Flair Guidelines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of Flair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some discussion and a few challenging flair request cases, we are significantly revising the way in which we label panelists in the hopes of making flair more clearly communicate certain sorts of panelist expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, a reminder of the purpose of flairs on &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike in some subreddits, the purpose of flairs on &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; are not to designate commenters&amp;#39; areas of interest. The purpose of flair is to indicate commenters&amp;#39; relevant expertise in philosophical areas and research. As philosophical issues are often complicated and have potentially thousands of years of research to sift through, knowing when someone is an expert in a given area can be important in helping understand and weigh the given evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Who Qualifies for Flair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this understanding, &lt;strong&gt;flair will only be given to those with research expertise in some area of philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;. Flair is not simply for those interested in a given area or topic, but rather for those who have studied it intensively and are qualified and prepared to provide well-researched and developed answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flair Areas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, flair will be given only in particular areas or research topics in philosophy. Typical areas include things like &amp;quot;philosophy of mind&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;logic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;continental philosophy&amp;quot;. Flair will not be granted for specific research subjects, e.g. &amp;quot;Kant on logic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;metaphysical grounding&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;epistemic modals&amp;quot;. Flair of specific philosophers will only be granted if that philosopher is clearly and uncontroversially a monumentally important philosopher, e.g. Confucius, Kant, Nietzsche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flair will be given in a maximum of three areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Varieties of Flair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, there was some confusion about the scope and difference between graduate and professional flair, and some reasoned disagreement about what sorts of academics might appropriately be understood to be experts about certain philosophical topics. As such, we have fully redesigned our flair guidelines and increased the types of flair to better respond to the various ways in which people develop their expertise and the various stages of that development which they find themselves in. The names of some of the categories remain the same, but their scope is slightly different to accommodate two new panelist areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autodidact&lt;/strong&gt; - The panelist has little or no formal education in philosophy, but is an enthusiastic self-educator and intense reader in a field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undergraduate&lt;/strong&gt; - The panelist is enrolled in or has completed formal undergraduate coursework in Philosophy. In the US system, for instance, this would be indicated by a major (BA) or minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graduate&lt;/strong&gt; - The panelist is enrolled in a graduate program or has completed an MA in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their coursework might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a degree in Philosophy. For example, a student with an MA in Literature whose coursework and thesis were focused on Derrida&amp;#39;s deconstruction might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to an MA in Philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PhD&lt;/strong&gt; - The panelist has completed a PhD program in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their degree might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in Philosophy. For example, a student with a PhD in Art History whose coursework and dissertation focused on aesthetics and critical theory might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional&lt;/strong&gt; - The panelist derives their full-time employment through philosophical work outside of academia. Such panelists might include Bioethicists working in hospitals, Lawyers who work on the Philosophy of Law, Ontologists, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Field&lt;/strong&gt; - The panelist has expertise in some sub-field of philosophy but their work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy. For example, a PhD in Physics whose research touches on issues relating to the entity/structural realism debate clearly has expertise relevant to philosophical issues but is reasonably understood to be working primarily in another field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new divisions aim primarily at two things: (1) more clearly communicating the kind of expertise held by panelists and (2) streamlining a few troublesome aspects of the flair application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Updating Your Flair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since some of these changes involve carving up old flair categories, some re-categorizations of panelists may be required. In order to make this as simple as possible, the flair conversion will go as follows for each respective, current flair category:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Autodidact flair holders (grey) remain as they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Undergraduate flair holders (red) remain as they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who do not hold PhDs in Philosophy or hold an equivalent PhD remain as they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work inside academia remain as they are. This flair category will be renamed &amp;quot;PhD.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following types of panelists should message moderators for a change in flair color:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who have completed a PhD in Philosophy or hold a PhD which is equivalent to a PhD in philosophy (as described above) should ask for a &amp;quot;PhD&amp;quot; flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Grad flair holders (yellow) who are active students or have completed just an MA in a related field but whose work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy should ask for a &amp;quot;Related Field&amp;quot; (green) flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work in in a related field but whose work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy should ask for a &amp;quot;Related Field&amp;quot; (green) flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Pro flair holders (purple) who work outside of academia should ask for a new &amp;quot;Pro&amp;quot; (blue) flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, panelists who could qualify for more than one type of flair are welcome to choose how to represent themselves. In making this choice, panelists should at least try to represent their expertise in a way that will match how they tend to answer questions in the sub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure whether or not you should be re-classified, then message the moderators and we will help sort out your flair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Requesting Flair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequent commenters should become panelists and request flair, pursuant to the above flair guidelines. To request flair, please send a message to the moderators via modmail with the subject &amp;#39;Flair Request for &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;, detailing which flair you are requesting and why. All flair requests should contain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flair type you are requesting (e.g. undergraduate, PhD, related field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The areas of flair you are requesting, up to 3 (e.g. Kant, continental philosophy, logic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief explanation of your background in philosophy, including what qualifies you for the flair you requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;does not require users to provide proof of their identifies for flair requests, nor to reveal their identities. There is thus an expectation that all frequent commenters will become panelists and request flair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Open Discussion Threads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; has an &amp;quot;Open Discussion Thread&amp;quot; (ODT), which is posted once a week and stickied to the top of the subreddit. These threads are a place for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily meet our posting rules. For example, these threads are great places for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Change My View&amp;quot; style discussions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion not necessarily related to any particular question, e.g. about what you&amp;#39;re currently reading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about academic philosophy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about therapy, psychology or self-help, e.g. &amp;quot;How do I deal with determinism?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that the ODTs provide a venue for the &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; community to engage in the types of discussion which do not formally meet our rules, but with and within the excellent community of &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;/r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The best way to view the world if you're a Marxist is through the lens of oppressed and oppressor. Now, the funny thing about that is that if you're a post-modernist is that that's actually an interpretation, right? It's a Marxist interpretation. And the interpretation is that the best way to look at the world is through the lens of oppressor versus oppressed, but if you're a post-modernist you don't get to have a canonical interpretation 'cause your whole damn theory is predicated on the notion that you don't get to have a canonical interpretation because no interpretation is better than any other interpretation.""* ([12:00 minute mark)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rUPatnXSE)

In short, my reasoning results from how we come to make beliefs and what we deem moral agents.  We can start with Socrates, as he provides arguments for what wisdom is.  Now many of us know his famous quote, ""the unexamined life is not worth living"".  Not reflecting on the rules or beliefs is a false sense of knowledge, operating mechanically like an animal or plant.  We wouldn't hold a lion as a moral agent because it does not partake in higher thinking.  A lion killing another lion to assert dominance over a pride is much different than a human man killing a married man in order to mate with his wife!

John Dewey creates a modern evolution of this that I think puts this quite eloquently.  In ""What is Thought"", he describes two types of thinking: (1) Beliefs that are accepted when their grounds have not themselves been considered. and (2) Beliefs that are accepted because their grounds have been examined.  For (1), we recognize that this type of thinking is a type of bias or prejudice and is unreflective.  Surely though, we hold people who form beliefs under both types of thinking as moral agents with the burden of the human mind.  

Yet from Socrates position, it seems as though we ought to always, within practicality, be reflective (type 2) thinkers.  In fact, under Socrates's position, what separates those who are type 1 thinkers from animals?  In ""Apology"", Socrates is said to have met with an Oracle he deemed him the wisest person, something he struggled with.  Yet he continually saw very few people were reflective thinkers.  If he, or someone like him, were to do wrong, it stands to reason that Socrates would believe this person is more morally culpable than a sophist or someone with false wisdom.

I could continue on and on, progressing through the history of philosophy with this question.  If a kantian ethicist were to violate a strict categorical imperative, are they more culpable than someone who commits the same wrong but has not training of ethics?  Or a strict Utilitarian who does something for his or her own good over the good of society?

Now I'm not proposing that Philosophers be jailed for extra time because they are more reflective thinkers, but can we argue that at least for an internal reflection an Philosopher Ethicist may be committing a greater wrong even when the action is the same of someone who is, for simplicity's sake, ignorant?

I'm not a law expert, but culpability and punishment of crime (at least in the U.S) is based on mental states and cognition.  Intentionally, knowingly, negligently, and recklessly are the usual mental states it seems from cursory research.  We hold those who know a bit more than others more accountable.  Does this mean we can hold people who know greater knowledge more accountable?

Is there any decision a parent should *not* make on behalf of their child?

At first, I thought there are a few things a parent should not decide: their child's occupation, spouse, and what wallpaper color their child should have in their adult home. Of course, these choices would interfere with their child's autonomy as an adult. If it were possible, legally, to sign a contract for your 14 year old child to work as a busboy for 40 years at a Denny's, it would seem that you ought not to, for your child should decided for themselves what they should do and where they should work past 18 years. The same could be said for marriage: your child, once they turn 18, ought to be able to decide whom they should marry themselves, and if they were already locked in a previous marriage their ability to do so would be hampered; eliminated, even, if divorce was illegal. 

It seems duration makes a decision one a parent should leave to their child. If the decision is lasting such that it carries on past the age of consent, then it interferes with your child's autonomy as an adult. The following example seems to illustrate this *at first.* Let's assume one has a right  to raise your child as whatever religion one wishes. It would seem, however, that even if one has this right, one does not have the right to brainwash their child such that they cannot choose a different religion once they turn 18, for then this would interfere with their ability to choose a religion as an adult, as the brainwashing has lasting consequences. 

However (and this is where I'm confused), every decision I mentioned in the beginning paragraph and even the example of religion have lasting consequences, longer than if the individual is 18, but this don't seem like decisions a parent shouldn't make for their child at all.  I suppose they aren't irreversible in the way a legal contract or brainwashing are, but one can hardly, for example, choose to forget a second language entirely.

I can provide necessary background if you haven't read the book but are still inclined to take a pass at it.  It is one of two arguments given in critique of logical positivist (esp. Carnap's) notions of the relationship between formal models and the empirical phenomenon to be modelled, in the book he makes substantial use of the analogy between how a mathematical logician models an algebraic structure (= syntactic rather than semantic for the purposes of this passage) with a set to which it applies (he sees this as much like scientific experimentation, = the semantic for the purposes of this passage), and the process of modelling in scientific contexts.  This passage immediately follows a discussion about how there are substantial mathematical relations between the syntactic and semantic, namely, a structure is consistent iff it has a model, a structure is complete iff it has only one model, and how this relationship is not one of logic and structure having strict precedence over the mathematical or intuitive, since basic mathematics is used in reasoning about structures.  

My impression is in the part right before this he's attempting to say that since it is evident that this opposition is overcome in the relationship between structure and model in mathematics, which is the inspiration for the scientific analogy, that we should expect (perhaps) similar instability in the related analogy between a formal model and the empirical facts it is meant to capture.  I think I get that, but this passage seems to be moving on to a new but related point towards the end of the paragraph.

But I can&amp;#39;t for the life of me see how women&amp;#39;s rights could solve the question, or even be relevant to the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is this dear redditers on &lt;a href=""/r/askphilosophy""&gt;r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt;: Does women&amp;#39;s rights solve the morale question about morale? if so, how? Is it even relevant? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is asked with virtue ethics in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;
